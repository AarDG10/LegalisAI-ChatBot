CORAM : S.C. GUPTE  DATE : 11 SEPTEMBER 2020  ( JUDGMENT )  . These Second Appeals, which are connected, are heard together. Mr. Sharma, learned Counsel appearing for the Appellant in Second Appeal ( , seeks leave to withdraw the appeal. The second appeal is dismissed as withdrawn with no order as to costs. In view of the disposal of the second appeal, the Interim Application made therein does not survive and is also disposed of.  2 The two remaining second appeals, i.e. Second Appeal ( , raise significant points of law arising under the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 43 of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (\"Act\"), concerning, particularly, pre-deposit to be ordered, when a promoter files an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal under sub-section (5) of Section 43 of the Act. The Appellants in both these appeals are claiming that they do not come under the expression \"promoter\"  used in the proviso and hence, are not liable to make any pre-deposit.  4 The Appellant in Second Appeal ( , i.e. 2  Chourangi Builders & Developers Pvt Ltd (\"Chourangi\"), was the original developer, who had issued allotment letters to the allottee flat purchasers contesting these appeals and who had entered into agreements for lease, covered by the Act, with them. The development rights, in pursuance of which these deocuments were executed, were originally conferred on Chourangi by Maharashtra Airport Development Company Limited (\"MADC\"), a Special Planning Authority under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 for colonizing areas around Nagpur Airport. It appears that MADC subsequently terminated the development agreement in favour of Chourangi and appointed Nagpur Integrated Township Pvt. Ltd (\"NIT\") - companion appellant in Second Appeal (  - as a developer for the project. A tripartite agreement was thereupon entered into between MADC, Chourangi and NIT for taking over of the project by the latter. In pursuance of this tripartite agreement, Chourangi claims to have given an option to all its allottees including the Respondents herein to opt either for return of their monies paid for their allotments or substitute their agreements by agreements with NIT for the allotted premises; in either case, it was NIT, who was to be responsible for dealing with the allottees. There are disputes between the parties on various issues arising out of this arrangement, such as, whether, under the tripartite agreement, NIT could be said to be liable to the allottees for any lapse on the part of Chourangi prior to the execution of the tripartite agreement, or whether the allottees in the present case had opted for any 3  particular option, and if so, which, or whether, so far as the allottees in the two second appeals herein are concerned, which of the two, i.e. Chourangi and NIT, could be said to be a promoter ? A prima facie appreciation of these issues was necessary to decide the question of application of the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 43 of the Act. Only after such appreciation could the Appellate Tribunal have passed a pre-deposit order either against Chourangi or against NIT or against both. Far from satisfying this mandate, what appears from the orders impugned herein by both Chourangi and NIT is that the Tribunal has passed orders of pre-deposit under the proviso against both without any discussion as to their respective status as promoter/s for the purposes of these appeals. An important question of law, besides the question on merit briefly indicated above, which immediately arises, as a result, is whether the Appellate Tribunal, whilst acting under sub-section (5) of Section 43 of the Act, could make an order of pre-deposit against any appellant before it without considering whether he is a \"promoter\" within the meaning of the proviso to that sub-section. The second appeals are, accordingly, admitted on this question of law and are taken up for hearing forthwith by consent of parties.  5 It is obvious that sub-section (5) of Section 43 of the Act entitles \"any person aggrieved by any direction or decision or order made by the authority or by an adjudicating officer\" under the Act to file an appeal. It is only when such appeal is filed by a promoter that the 4  proviso to sub-section (5) is attracted. When a promoter files an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal, such appeal cannot be entertained, by virtue of the proviso, unless the promoter first deposits with the Appellate Tribunal at least 30 per cent of the penalty or such higher percentage as may be determined by the Tribunal or of the total amount to be paid to the allottees including interest and compensation imposed on him, if any, or both, as the case may be. It may well be that an order for payment of compensation or damages is made by the authority or by the adjudicating officer under the Act against a party, without such party being in the position of a promoter within the applicable meaning of that expression. If such party were then to approach the Appellate Authority, there is no way the Appellate Authority could order pre-deposit against it under the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 43. In other words, for the purpose of acting under the proviso to Section 43(5) of the Act, whether or not the Appellant is a promoter within the meaning of that expression used in the proviso, is a jurisdictional question to be decided by the Appellate Tribunal before any order of pre-deposit could be passed. This is not to say that the controversy, namely, whether the particular appellant before the Tribunal is such a promoter is to be finally decided by the Appellate Tribunal when its makes an order of pre-deposit. What is imperative is that whenever such question is legitimately raised and falls for consideration of the Tribunal, it must take at least a prima facie view of the matter and only thereupon pass an order of pre-deposit. 5  6 The Appellate Tribunal, in the present case, appears to have been completely oblivious of the controversy raised by both appellants in these appeals; it does not even refer to the question as to whether Chourangi or NIT or both could be termed as 'promoters' within the meaning of that expression under the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 43. This obviously cannot be countenanced. For the reasons, more particularly indicated above, it was imperative for the Tribunal to at least take a prima facie view on this issue and only then proceed to order pre-deposit against either Chourangi or NIT or both. The impugned order, thus, deserves to be quashed and set aside.  7 Both second appeals, i.e. Second Appeal ( , are, accordingly, allowed, by quashing and setting aside the impugned common order dated 18 August 2020, and remitting the appeals to the Appellate Tribunal for making a fresh order under the proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 43 in the light of the observations made hereinabove.  8 It is made clear that whilst passing this order, this court has not applied its mind to the merits of the controversy, particularly, whether either of the Appellants before this court or both could be termed as promoters within the meaning of that expression under the proviso of sub-section (5) to Section 43 of the Act, and also whether, if both are to be considered as promoters, the whole of permissible pre-deposit could have been ordered against both. These questions are 6  to be considered by the Tribunal at the remand hearing. All rights and contentions of the parties in that behalf are kept open.  9 Both second appeals are disposed of accordingly. Considering the fact that this is an old matter which deserves to be disposed of early, the Appellate Tribunal is requested to consider the matter as expeditiously as possible and preferably within two months from today.  10 In view of the disposal of the second appeals, the Interim Applications, namely, Interim Application  , respectively, made therein do not survive and are also disposed of.  11 This order will be digitally signed by the Personal Assistant of this Court. All concerned will act on production by fax or email of a digitally signed copy of this order.  (S.C. GUPTE, J.) 7"} ,

KATHAWALLA, J.) 1. By the above Writ Petition Shri Rustam Phiroze Mehta (‘the Petitioner’) has prayed for a writ in the nature of Mandamus or any other appropriate writ against Respondent Nos. 2 and 3, i.e. The Collector, Pune District and The Tahsildar, Pune City respectively, mandating them to comply with the Order-cumDirections dated 15\" April, 2019 issued by the Maharashtra Real Estate and Regulatory Authority, Mumbai. By an Order dated 20\" January, 2021 the Petitioner was allowed to amend the Petition and seek further ad-interim / interim reliefs against Respondent No. 4 - Marvel Sigma Homes Private Limited which reliefs are sought in aid of the final relief. 2. Admit. 3. By this Order, we will consider whether the Petitioner is entitled to the following interim reliefs as sought in the present Writ Petition (as amended pursuant to Order dated 20\" January, 2021): “b)(ti) That pending the hearing and final disposal of the present Petition, Respondent No.4 and/or its group companies, their officers, servants, agents, assigns, representatives and any other person, claiming through or under them, be restrained by a temporary injunction from directly or indirectly in any manner selling, transferring or creating any third party rights in any of their movable or immovable properties; b)(tat) That pending the hearing and final disposal of the present Petition, this Hon?ble Court be pleased to direct Respondent No.4 to deposit the principal sum of Rs.11,36,33,625/- admittedly payable by Respondent No. 4 to the Petitioner or any other amount as this Hon’ble Court may deem fit, to be appropriated towards the decretal amount payable by the Respondent No. 4 to the Petitioner.” 4. Apart from considering whether the Petitioner is entitled to the above interim reliefs sought in prayer clauses b(ii) and b(ili) reproduced hereinabove, we will also consider herein whether Respondent No. 4 acting through its Director, Shri Vishwajeet Jhavar (‘Shri Jhavar’) has interfered with the administration of justice by breaching various Orders of Disclosure passed by this Court against Respondent No. 4 by filing false Affidavits of Disclosure. If we are prima facie satisfied of such conduct, we will then proceed to consider what action ought to be taken in relation to such breach, keeping in mind the fact that this is not a Contempt Petition under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (‘Contempt of Courts Act’) but a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. SUBJECT MATTER OF THE PRESENT WRIT PETITION: 5. The present Writ Petition (L) No. 3221 of 2020 has been filed by the Petitioner who was the Original Complainant before the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (“RERA’). The Petitioner is an “allottee” as defined under Section 2(d) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (‘the said Act’). Respondent No.1 is the State of Maharashtra. Respondent No.2 is the Collector, Pune (‘the Collector’). Respondent No.3 is the Tahsildar, Pune (‘the Tahsildar’). Respondent No. 4 is Marvel Sigma Homes Pvt. Ltd. (‘Respondent No. 4’), a Company engaged in the business of development and construction. 5.1. The Petitioner had filed Complaint No. CC005000000010528 (‘the Complaint’) under Sections 12, 14, 18 and 19 of the said Act against Respondent No. 4. The main grievance in the Complaint before RERA was that under Articles of Agreement dated 1° August 2014, the Petitioner paid the entire consideration of Rs.10,61,18,790/- to Respondent No. 4 towards purchase of Flat No. 1001 admeasuring 326.55 sq. mtrs., on the 10th floor, ‘A’ Wing in Respondent No. 4’s Project ‘Marvel Ribera’ at Pune, alongwith two covered car parking spaces and an open terrace admeasuring 119.10 sq. mtrs. (Carpet area) collectively referred to as (‘the said Premises’) and that there was a gross delay in handing over possession of the said Premises. Therefore, the Petitioner filed the Complaint seeking return of the amount paid and interest thereon, including compensation under the aforesaid provisions of RERA. 5.2. By an Order dated 1* March, 2018, (‘the said Order’), the Adjudicating Officer allowed the said Complaint and directed Respondent No. 4 to pay Rs.14,05,57,705.46 (Rupees Fourteen Crores Five Lakhs, Fifty-Seven Thousand Seven Hundred and Five and Forty-Six Paisa only) along with interest at the rate of 10.05% p.a. (‘the Decretal Amount’) to the Petitioner. 5.3. As Respondent No. 4 failed to pay the Decretal Amount, the Petitioner initiated execution proceedings against Respondent No. 4. The said execution proceedings were allowed by RERA and consequently RERA issued a Recovery Certificate dated 12\" April, 2019, against Respondent No. 4 for recovering the Decretal Amount as arrears of land revenue. Thereafter, RERA on 15\" April, 2019, vide its Letter of even date, directed the Collector to execute the said Recovery Certificate. A copy of this Letter was not forwarded to the Petitioner. By its Letter dated 4\" June, 2019, the Collector directed the Tahsildar to execute the Recovery Certificate. The earlier Letter of RERA dated 15\" April, 2019 addressed to the Collector was referred to therein. A copy of this Letter dated 4° June, 2019 was forwarded to the Petitioner. According to the Petitioner, despite the aforesaid direction dated 15\" April, 2019, the Collector and the Tahsildar both failed to comply with the said direction and failed in performing their statutory obligations. The Petitioner addressed a letter to Respondent No. 3 - Tahsildar calling upon him to take steps for realising the amount due to the Petitioner. As there was no action taken by Respondent No. 3 - Tahsildar and Respondent No. 2 - Collector, the Petitioner filed the present Writ Petition under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, seeking issuance of a Writ of Mandamus against the Collector and Tahsildar to comply with the Direction dated 15\" April, 2019 and to perform their statutory duties to recover the amounts under the Recovery Certificate as arrears of land revenue. According to the Petitioner, till today an amount of approximately Rs.17,45,50,137.14/- (Rupees Seventeen Crores Forty-Five Lakhs Fifty Thousand One Hundred Thirty- Seven and Fourteen Paisa Only) is due and payable by the Respondent No. 4 to the Petitioner. 5.4. In aid of the final relief that is sought against the Respondent Nos. 2 and 3, the Petitioner seeks interim reliefs against Respondent No. 4 and its group companies, so that the amount to be paid to the Petitioner under the Recovery Certificate is protected till such time as the statutory authorities secure the recovery of the same as arrears of land revenue. ORDER DATED 9\" MARCH, 2021: 6. After the present Writ Petition was filed by the Petitioner and various Orders of Disclosure were passed against Respondent No. 4, which are referred to below, Respondent No. 4 filed Interim Application (L) No. 2044 of 2021 challenging the maintainability of the present Writ Petition. Respondent No. 4 also filed Writ Petition No. 2657 of 2020 challenging the Direction dated 4\" June, 2019 issued by the Collector directing the Tahsildar to execute the Recovery Certificate dated 12\" April, 2019 issued by RERA against Respondent No. 4. Since Respondent No. 4 challenged the maintainability of the present Writ Petition, this Court considered it necessary to decide the said Interim Application before considering the application for interim reliefs in this Writ Petition. As the grounds of challenge with respect to the maintainability of the present Writ Petition raised in the aforesaid Interim Application filed by Respondent No. 4 and the challenge to the manner of execution of the Recovery Certificate in Writ Petition No. 2657 of 2020 also filed by Respondent No. 4, were substantially the same, both were heard together. 6.1. By an Order and Judgment dated 9\" March, 2021, the aforesaid Interim Application and Writ Petition No. 2657 of 2020 were dismissed, and the hearing of the present Writ Petition including the application for interim reliefs sought by the Petitioner, were directed to proceed. We were informed that Respondent No. 4 has filed a Special Leave Petition against the Order and Judgment dated 9\" March, 2021. It appears that the Special Leave Petition has not been circulated for listing and there is no stay in relation to the present proceedings. ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION : 7. Pursuant to the Order dated 9\" March, 2021, we proceeded to hear the present Writ Petition. The two issues which have fallen for our determination are as under : 7.1. Whether Respondent No. 4 and its Director Shri Jhavar have interfered with the administration of justice by filing false and incorrect Affidavits of Disclosure and by also violating and breaching various Orders of this Court?; If so, the consequences of such breach? 7.2. Whether the Petitioner is entitled to interim reliefs set out in the prayer clauses (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) of the present Writ Petition, especially considering that Respondent No. 4 is a Private Limited Company? FACTUAL BACKGROUND : 8. Since the factual background of the disputes has been set out in detail in the Order dated 9 March, 2021, we are not repeating the same in the present Order. The relevant facts have also been set out in the earlier paragraphs of this Order. ORDERS OF THE COURT AND AFFIDAVITS OF THE RESPONDENTS: 9. Before recording the submissions of the parties on the issues set out in paragraph 7 hereinabove, it is necessary to set out in detail the events that transpired during the hearing of the present Writ Petition. 9.1. On 3\" March, 2020, after hearing the Advocates for the parties and being prima facie satisfied that there had been inaction by the Collector and the Tahsildar in performing their statutory duties and complying with the aforesaid Direction dated 15\" April, 2019, issued to them by RERA, the Tahsildar was directed to remain present before this Court on 5\" March, 2020. 9.2. On 5™ March, 2020, the Tahsildar could not remain present and requested this Court to keep the matter on 6 March, 2020. In view thereof, the matter was adjourned to 6\" March, 2020. 9.3. On 6\" March, 2020, the Tahsildar personally remained present before this Court. On the same date, the Tahsildar filed an Affidavit in Reply to the Petition. It states that after receiving the said Direction dated 15\" April, 2019 from RERA, his office had issued two Demand Notices dated 11\" September, 2019 and 10\" January, 2020 respectively to Respondent No. 4, calling upon Respondent No. 4 to pay the said Decretal Amount. Respondent No. 4 failed to respond to these Demand Notices. The Tahsildar then carried out a search of Respondent No. 4’s properties and came across Property Cards in the name of Marvel Imperial Co-operative Housing Society Ltd., Marvel Crest Condominium, etc. However, the Affidavit states that as the name on these Property Cards was not the same as that of Respondent No. 4, i.e. ‘Marvel Sigma Homes Pvt. Ltd.’, the Tahsildar could not execute the said Recovery Certificate against Respondent No. 4. The stand of the Tahsildar in justification of him not having taken any steps towards recovery of the amounts mentioned in the RERA Recovery Certificate, is reproduced hereunder : “6. I say that as per direction of the RERA, the Respondent No. 3 started the procedure by sending two notices and searching the property of Respondent No. 4, movable as well as immovable for attachment. But, due to closure of 7/12 extract, it is difficult to find out the property of the Respondent No. 4. I further say that recently, the office of the undersigned got property card of similar name of the Respondent No. 4. However, after going through the said property card, it is revealed that the title name is different i.e. Marvel Imperial Co-operative Housing Society Ltd., City Survey No. 260, area 9875.76 sq. mtrs. The second similar name t.e. Marvel Crest Condominium, City Survey No. 363.929 sq. mtr. The third similar name ts i.e. Goel Ganga Construction & Real Estate Pyt. Ltd., City Survey No. 207, area 11027.68 sq. mtrs. Hereto annexed and marked as Exhibit 5 Colly. are copies of the Property Cards. 7. I say that as the address provided by RERA is different from property card and Respondent No. 4’s property and hence, our office is facing difficulty in searching the property of the Respondent No. 4 for attachment and further procedure. I say that our office had started the proceeding from 12.06.2019 however, due to different title and address, it is difficult to us to search Respondent No. 4’s property and to complete further procedure. I say that hence, there is no delay from our side in the abovesaid matter. If the Hon’ble Court directs the Respondent No. 4 i.e. defaulters to give proper title name and address and mention the whole property of Respondent No. 4, it will be easy for us to attach and recover the due amount from Respondent No. 4 and hand over the said due amount to the Petitioner.” 9.4. In addition to referring to the averments in the Affidavit of the Tahsildar, we have also perused the extract of the Property Card annexed to the Affidavit itself. Contrary to the Tahsildar’s understanding that names and addresses in the Property Card are different from those mentioned in the Recovery Certificate, the Property Card itself indicates that one of the projects or developments, namely, Marvel Crest, is a property or project in the name of Respondent No. 4. 9.5. In view of the aforesaid submissions made by the Tahsildar, a statement was made on behalf of Respondent No. 4 that they shall file an Affidavit setting out the assets of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities within one week. The said statement was accepted by this Court and the following Order dated 6\" March, 2020 was passed : “1. Respondent No. 4 states that the disclosure Affidavit in Reply setting out the assets of the Respondent No. 4 and its group entities shall be filed within one week from today. This statement is accepted.” 9.6. On 11 March, 2020, Respondent No. 3 - Tahsildar, Pune, addressed a Letter to RERA stating that she was unable to locate any assets standing in the name of Respondent No. 4 and was therefore unable to execute the Order dated 15\" April, 2020. This Letter was produced by the Petitioner as part of a Compilation of Documents. It has not been disputed by any of the parties. 9.7. Pursuant to the Order of 6 March, 2020, Shri Jhavar, Director of Respondent No. 4, filed an Affidavit of Disclosure dated 12° March, 2020 (“1 Disclosure Affidavit”). In the 1* Disclosure Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 only made a disclosure with respect to its Project ‘Marvel Ribera’, at Boat Club Road, Pune, in which the Petitioner had purchased the said Premises. Respondent No. 4 disclosed that, (i) the said Project ‘Marvel Ribera’ had a total of 27 flats, (ii) out of the total 27 flats, 11 have been sold and an amount of Rs. 18,54,05,681/- was receivable from the said flats, (iii) the remaining 16 flats are unsold, but were mortgaged to ICICI Home Finance Ltd. under a Mortgage Deed dated 29\" May, 2017. Further in paragraph 7, Respondent No. 4 made a statement that, “Marvel Sigma Homes Private Limited apart from above has no other property”. (Emphasis supplied). 9.8. Thereafter due to the extended lockdown and suspension of physical hearings in this Court due to the Covid-19 pandemic, this matter could be taken up only on 14\" January, 2021. At that time, the Advocates for the Petitioner informed this Court that by the aforesaid Order dated 6\" March, 2020, Respondent No. 4 was directed to disclose “all” assets of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities. Despite the said Order, Respondent No. 4 had only disclosed details in respect of one of its Projects and had not disclosed its other assets. In support of his contention the Petitioner filed a Compilation of Documents comprising of details of the various projects of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities as available on the official website of RERA, the sold and unsold units therein, etc., that constituted the assets of Respondent No. 4, which Respondent No. 4 had not disclosed in its 1* Disclosure Affidavit. 9.9. After perusing the 1* Disclosure Affidavit and the aforesaid Compilation of Documents filed by the Petitioner, it was clear that Respondent No. 4 had violated the Order dated 6\" March, 2020 and had not disclosed, (i) all other assets of Respondent No. 4; (ii) all assets of its group entities; (iii) details as to when the amount of Rs. 18,54,05,681/- was receivable from the purchasers of the sold units in Marvel Ribera; (iv) the sold and unsold units in Respondent No. 4’s projects, vez. Marvel Bounty, Marvel Cascada, Marvel Crest, etc.; (iv) the sold and unsold units in projects of its group entities, viz. Marvel Fuego, Marvel Arco, Marvel Cerise, Marvel Aurum, Marvel Sangria, Marvel Ideal Spacio, etc.; (v) bank account details of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities, monies lying therein and other investments and (vi) other immovable assets of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities. 9.10. In view of the aforesaid, this Court by its Order dated 14\" January, 2021 noted the aforesaid breach by Respondent No. 4 and granted an opportunity to Respondent No. 4 to comply with the Order dated 6\" March, 2020 in its true letter and spirit and adjourned the matter to 20\" January, 2021. By the said Order dated 14\" January, 2021, this Court directed as under: “3. Instead of issuing notice at this stage calling upon the Director of Respondent No. 4 to show cause as to why action should not be taken against him for breach of the statement made before this Court on 6th March, 2020, we are giving an opportunity to Mr. Vishwajeet Subhash Jhavar, Director of Respondent No. 4 - Marvel Sigma Homes Private Limited, to comply with his statement as recorded and accepted in our Order dated 6th March, 2020, on or before the adjourned date. Needless to add that the said statement shall be complied with in its true letter and spirit.” (Emphasis supplied). 9.11. Thereafter, Shri Jhavar on behalf of Respondent No. 4 filed an Affidavit of Disclosure dated 19\" January, 2021 (“2\"™ Disclosure Affidavit”), wherein Respondent No. 4 enclosed a Statement of Assets and Liabilities of Respondent No. 4 and its seven group entities, viz. (i) Marvel Realtors & Developers Ltd., (ii) Marvel Omega Builders Pvt Ltd. (iii) Marvel Zeta Developers Pvt. Ltd. (iv) Marvel Landmarks Private Limited (v) PAX Homes LLP (vi) Hallmark Marvel Realtors and (vii) Marvel Realtors. In the said Statement, Respondent No. 4 disclosed, (i) names of certain projects of Respondent No. 4 and the said seven group entities; (ii) sold and unsold area in the disclosed projects; (iii) cumulative bank balances lying in the bank accounts of Respondent No. 4 and the seven group entities; (iv) encumbrances over the disclosed projects. 9.12. On 20\" January, 2021, when the matter came up for hearing, the Advocates for the Petitioner informed this Court that despite this Court granting an opportunity to Respondent No. 4 to comply with the Order dated 6\" March, 2020 in its true letter and spirit, Respondent No. 4 had once again provided an incomplete and misleading Disclosure. The Advocates for the Petitioner tendered a list of group companies and LLPs of Respondent No. 4, as available on the official website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which showed that Respondent No. 4 had not disclosed assets of 12 group companies and 4 LLPs. The Advocates for the Petitioner also informed this Court that even for the entities disclosed, Respondent No. 4 had only provided partial details and had not disclosed, (a) details of each of the bank accounts of these entities and monies lying therein; (b) particulars of each of the bank accounts of disclosed entities/projects; (c) sold and unsold units in projects of these disclosed entities and monies receivable from the sale of these units; (d) other movable assets and investments of these entities. 9.13. In view of the repeated breaches by Respondent No. 4 in complying with the Orders passed, this Court directed Shri Jhavar to remain personally present in Court on 25\" January, 2021. 9.14. On 25\" January, 2021, Shri Jhavar was personally present before this Court. On that day the Advocate appearing on behalf of Respondent No. 4 informed this Court that in compliance of the Order dated 6 March, 2020, they now had “all” documents ready. The Court then granted another opportunity to Respondent No. 4 to comply with the Orders of this Court and directed Respondent No. 4 to place the said documents on Affidavit and furnish a copy of the same to the Advocate for Petitioner by 27\" January, 2021, and the matter was adjourned to 2™ February, 2021. 9.15. Pursuant thereto, Shri Jhavar filed an Affidavit of Disclosure dated 27\" January, 2021 (“3\" Disclosure Affidavit”). By the 3™ Disclosure Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 produced/disclosed (i) Statement of Assets and Liabilities of Respondent No. 4 and its aforesaid seven group entities; (ii) List of sold and unsold units of some of the projects of Respondent No. 4 and the said seven group entities; (iii) Uncertified Bank Statements of some bank accounts of Respondent No. 4 and the said seven group entities and (iv) Mortgage Documents in respect of the assets owned by Respondent No. 4 and some of its said seven group entities. Further in paragraph 3 of the 3“ Disclosure Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 made the following statement: “3. I say that since the Respondent No. 4 and its other companies are vast, there might be some of the assets/projects/receivable, which inadvertently are not stated in the Affidavits, the Respondent No. 4 crave leave of Hon’ble Court to put the said properties on affidavits if the same is pointed to us.” (Emphasis Supplied) 9.16. On 2\" February, 2021, the Advocates for the Petitioner informed this Court that even the 3\" Disclosure Affidavit was incomplete and Respondent No. 4 had once again filed the Disclosure Affidavit only in respect of Respondent No. 4 and the said seven group entities despite the Petitioner on the previous occasion pointing out the various other group entities of Respondent No. 4. In view of the aforesaid, by our Order dated 2™! February, 2021, we directed the Petitioner to file an Affidavit setting out all the non-disclosures / breaches by Respondent No. 4 and the matter was adjourned to 10\" February, 2021. 9.17. On 8\" February, 2021, the Tahsildar levied a charge for Rs. 6,25,20,100/- on the Respondent No. 4’s land bearing no. 30/A, Boat Club Road, Pune. 9.18. The Petitioner filed an Affidavit dated 9\" February, 2021, setting out the repeated breaches of Respondent No. 4 in complying with the aforesaid Orders passed by this Court. The Petitioner by the said Affidavit stated as under: 9.18.1. That despite being given multiple opportunities to comply with the Orders passed by this Court, Respondent No. 4 had deliberately and willfully failed to comply with these Orders and that the Respondent No. 4 even after filing three Disclosure Affidavits, had failed to disclose the following assets: \"a. Assets of 18 group entities of Respondent No. 4. b. Inventory of sold and unsold flats in the following projects zz. (i) Marvel Izara (ii) Marvel Tupe (iv) Marvel Cerise (v) Marvel Chaitanya (vi) Marvel Vimannagar (vii) Marvel Ideal Spacio (viii) Marvel Brisa (ix) Marvel Cetrine (xii) Marvel Aries (xiii) Marvel Cascada (xiv) Marvel Crest (xv) Marvel Castella (xvi) Marvel Arista (xvii) Marvel Merlot (xviii) Marvel Zephyr, etc. c. Details of all the bank accounts of Respondent No. 4 and the seven disclosed entities. d. Bank account details of the following projects being owned and developed by Respondent No. 4 and the said seven entities were not disclosed - Marvel Castella, Marvel Crest, Marvel Ecaso, Marvel Senitel, Marvel Merlot, Marvel Zephyr, Marvel Isola, Marvel Amora, Marvel Claro, Marvel Diva, Marvel Arista. e. From the unsold units in the disclosed projects, Respondent No. 4 failed to disclose which flats were mortgaged.\" 9.18.2. That Marvel Precast Structures India LLP, one of the aforesaid 18 entities, was actively carrying on the business of manufacturing fabricated metal products. A perusal of the balance sheet of Marvel Precast, downloaded from the MCA Website, showed that the current assets of Marvel Precast amounted to Rs. 1,11,53,002/-, which included trade receivables of Rs. 1,50,044/-, cash & cash equivalents of Rs. 8,62,459/- and Rs. 95,73,580/- being an amount advanced by way of loan and advances to third parties/vendors. The details also showed that there was no charge on the assets of the said LLP. 9.18.3. That Marvel Ora Residences LLP, one of the aforesaid 18 entities, was also actively carrying on its business. As per the Balance Sheet for FY 2019 - 2020, the value of its current assets was Rs. 59,99,94,667/- and current capital account was Rs.18,86,91,887/-. Further, the current assets included cash equivalent of Rs. 5,745/-, short term loans advanced by Marvel Ora amounting to Rs. 59,99,94,667/- (advanced to related parties) and other current assets amounting to Rs. 55,27,180/-. Further, as per the records available on the official website of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, there was no charge on the assets of this entity. 9.18.4. That in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities annexed to the 3\" Disclosure Affidavit read with the Mortgage Documents filed by Respondent No. 4, Shri Jhavar on behalf of Respondent No. 4, sought to represent that Respondent No. 4 was debt ridden and all its projects and the unsold units therein were mortgaged to various banks and/or financial institutions due to which it was unable to pay the said Decretal Amount. However, contrary to the aforesaid representation, Shri Jhavar on 20\" September, 2020 had addressed an email to all its customers/purchasers inter alia informing them that in the last 18 months Marvel Group had sold over 1000 units across their various projects, including Marvel Cerise, Marvel Arco, Marvel Brisa, Marvel Ecaso, Marvel Cascada, etc. and had been simultaneously successful in reducing its debt by 70% and have a target to be debt-free by March 2021. The Petitioner stated that this clearly showed that Respondent No. 4 has been consistently making false and misleading statements regarding its financial status before this Court to suit its benefit. 9.18.5. That Respondent No. 4. on_ its Official § Website, www.marvelrealtors.com, has stated that it was one of the “Top Real Estate Developers in Pune” and has developed various projects in Pune and Bangalore. Further, it was also stated on the Website that Respondent No. 4 and its group entities had completed 35 projects in Pune and Bangalore. Further it was stated that Respondent No. 4 and its group companies were currently developing 10 projects in Pune, viz. Marvel Piazza, Marvel Ideal Spacio, Marvel Fria, Marvel Acquanas, Selva Ridge, Marvel Ribera, Marvel Aurum, Marvel Basilo, Marvel Ecaso, Marvel Isola and 2 projects in Bangalore viz. Marvel Arista and Marvel Orial. 9.18.6 That Respondent No. 4 had several FIR’s registered against it for offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Maharashtra Ownership of Flat Purchasers Act, 1963. 9.19. Thereafter, Respondent No. 4 filed its Affidavit of Disclosure dated 16\" February, 2021 (“4™ Disclosure Affidavit”), without any liberty being granted to Respondent No. 4 to file such Affidavit. In any event, we accepted the said Affidavit and took it on record. By the said Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 sought to justify the non-disclosures of Respondent No. 4, as pointed out by the Petitioner in its aforesaid Affidavit dated 9\" February, 2021. The explanation provided by Respondent No. 4 in the 4\" Disclosure Affidavit is summarized as under: 9.19.1. That in its 1* Disclosure Affidavit, it disclosed only assets in Marvel Ribera because they were under the impression that the assets in the said project were “sufficient” to comply with the Order dated 6\" March, 2020. 9.19.2. Respondent No. 4 admitted that it had only provided disclosure of bank accounts of its “major” entities. 9.19.3. Respondent No. 4 admitted that it had not provided details of certain projects as they were “completed” and therefore the disclosure was “irrelevant”. The said statement / admission statement of Respondent No. 4 is reproduced hereunder: “3. I say that myself have already disclose the bank accounts of major entities. I say that so far as remaining entities are concern, following is the detail chart as to the status of the said bank accounts and perusal of the said chart would itself make it clear that most of the projects are complete and therefore the disclosure of the same was irrelevant. 9. ...1 say that major projects has already been disclosed by me. I say that so far as the Petitioner contention is concern in respect of remaining projects; I say that the said are irrelevant in respects of the present subject matter.” (Emphasis supplied) 9.19.4. Respondent No. 4 sought to disclose details of assets of following projects: Marvel Castella, Marvel Crest, Marvel Ecaso, Marvel Senitel, Marvel Selva Ridge, Marvel Orial, Marvel Sangria, Marvel Fria, Marvel Piazza, Marvel Izarra, Marvel Amora, Marvel Claro, Marvel Diva. 19.5. Respondent No. 4 admitted that it had not filed disclosure of other group entities because the same was “irrelevant”. Respondent No. 4 by this Affidavit sought to provide a status of the other group entities. It is necessary to reproduce this statement of Respondent No. 4: “4, So far as para No. 15 is concerns, I say that myself has disclose the information of the major group entities. I say that so far as the other group entities are concern the disclosure of the same was irrelevant and the below chart would clearly reflect the same.\" (Emphasis supplied) 9.19.6. Respondent No. 4 admitted that it had only disclosed “major projects” and did not disclose other projects as their details were “irrelevant”. 9.20. According to the Petitioner, even the 4 Disclosure Affidavit was incomplete and false for the following reasons: 9.20.1. Respondent No. 4 only disclosed bank account numbers of the projects Marvel Castella, Marvel Crest, Marvel Ecaso, Marvel Senitel, Marvel Selva Ridge, Marvel Orial, Marvel Sangria, Marvel Fria, Marvel Piazza, Marvel Izarra, Marvel Amora, Marvel Claro, Marvel Diva. No bank statement or details of monies lying therein were disclosed for these Projects. 9.20.2. According to Respondent No. 4’s official website, projects Marvel Orial, Marvel Fria, Marvel Piazza, Marvel Selva Ridge are ‘ongoing’ projects, which Respondent No. 4 falsely represented as ‘completed’. The websites and other information of the Marvel Group that are available online clearly establish this. 9.20.3. No disclosure of sold / unsold inventory is made with regard to Marvel Izara, Marvel Zephyr, Marvel Cerise, Marvel Ideal Spacio, Marvel Brisa, Marvel Citrine, Marvel Arise, Marvel Cascada, Marvel Crest, etc. 20.4. Even in respect to the entities referred to in the chart / table below paragraph 4 (described as ‘other group entities whose disclosure is irrelevant’), it is clear that there were assets that ought to have been disclosed even if those entities are not carrying out any projects. This would include disclosure of unsold inventory of Kappa Infra Ventures Private Limited; the land owned by Marvel Luxury Realtors Private Limited; the land or consideration for sale of land by Marvel Mega Realtors Private Limited; the current assets including the receivables of Marvel Precast Structures India LLP and Marvel Ora Residences. 9.21. According to the Petitioner, despite having filed four Disclosure Affidavits, Respondent No. 4 has still not fully complied with the aforesaid Orders dated 6\" March, 2020 and 14\" January, 2021, passed by this Court and the following assets still remain undisclosed: 9.21.1 Details/particulars of when the amount of Rs. 18,54,05,681/- is receivable from sold units in ‘Marvel Ribera’. 9.21.2. Movable and Immovable assets of the following entities - Kappa Infra Ventures Pvt. Ltd., Marvel Skyscrapers Pvt. Ltd., Marvel Dreamland Homes Pvt. Ltd., Marvel Foundation, Marveledge Realtors Pvt. Ltd., Epsillon Real Estate Pvt. Ltd., Marvel Asta Constructions Pvt. Ltd., Kappa Homes LLP, Marvel Precast structures India LLP, Marvel Ora Residences LLP, Marvel Group Holdings and Investments LLP, Marvel Elegant Homes LLP. 9.21.3. Bank account statements and details of monies lying therein for the following projects owned by Respondent No. 4 and its group entities viz. Marvel Castella, Marvel Crest, Marvel Ecaso, Marvel Senitel, Marvel Piazza, Marvel Merlot, Marvel Zephyr, Marvel Isola, Marvel Amora, Marvel Claro, Marvel Diva, Marvel Arista. 9.21.4. Even for projects disclosed, all bank account details have not been provided. 9.21.5. Inventory of sold and unsold flats for the following projects owned and developed by Respondent No. 4 viz., (i) Marvel Aries (ii) Marvel Cascada (iii) Marvel Crest and (iv) Marvel Castella. 9.21.6. Inventory of sold and unsold flats for the following projects owned and developed by the group entities of Respondent No. 4 viz., (i) Marvel Izara (11) Marvel Tupe (ili) Marvel Cerise (iv) Marvel Chaitanya (v) Marvel Vimannagar (vi) Marvel Ideal Spacio (vii) Marvel Brisa (viii) Marvel Cetrine (ix) Marvel Arista (x) Marvel Merlot (xi) Marvel Zephyr, etc. 9.21.7. Marvel Precast Structures India LLP and Marvel Ora Residences LLP, are two group entities whose financial statements and assets were not disclosed. The Petitioner states that this is significant because both of them disclose substantial current assets in their financial statements. In the case of Marvel Ora Residences LLP, the current assets amount to Rs. 59,99,94,667/- and the capital account reflects an amount of Rs. 18,86,91,887/-. This entity appears to have given a short-term loan to another group entity. The Petitioner states that these details have been withheld in the earlier disclosures because it would show the capacity of Respondent No. 4 and its related entities to satisfy the Recovery Certificate, which it is obstructing. ORDER PASSED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA : 10. On 28\" February, 2021, after this Court had granted three opportunities to Respondent No. 4 to fully comply with the Orders of Disclosure dated 6\" March, 2020 and 14\" January, 2021, and the Respondent No. 4 had filed three Disclosure Affidavits, Respondent No. 4 challenged these Orders by filing SLP (C) No. 2122/2021 and SLP (C) No. 2123/2021 before the Supreme Court. 10.1. By an Order dated 12\" February, 2021, the Supreme Court while upholding the approach adopted by this Court, dismissed the said SLPs. By the said Order, the Supreme Court held as under: “We give our full imprimatur to the approach adopted by the High Court to ensure that in one manner or the other the petitioner honours the decree which has been passed against him. The Special Leave Petition is dismissed. Pending applications stand disposed of.” (Emphasis supplied) It is relevant to note here that Respondent No. 4 never served a copy of the said SLPs upon the Petitioner. The Petitioner had not filed a caveat before the Supreme Court and was therefore not aware of the filing of the SLP or the Order. Further Respondent No. 4 also suppressed the aforesaid Order dated 12\" February, 2021 from this Court, despite the matter having been heard after that. This Court learnt of the aforesaid Order only upon receiving a copy of it from the Supreme Court Registry. In fact, Advocate Shri Amit Gharte representing Respondent No. 4 before us informed us that even he was not aware of the SLP’s being filed by Respondent No. 4 before the Supreme Court, since the same were filed by engaging some other Advocates. SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES: ISSUE NO. 1: AS SET OUT IN PARAGRAPH 7.1.: 11. Shri Sharan Jagtiani, Learned Senior Advocate representing the Petitioner has made the following submissions : 11.1. That after the Order dated 6\" March, 2020 was passed, this Court granted multiple opportunities to Respondent No. 4 to comply with its Orders. Respondent No. 4 not only failed to comply with the said Orders but also made false and incorrect statements in the said four Disclosure Affidavits in order to mislead this Court thereby obstructing the administration of justice and delaying the hearing of this Writ Petition for grant of urgent interim reliefs. 11.2. That the following instances clearly show that Respondent No. 4 has disobeyed the Orders passed by this Court and made false and incorrect statements during the hearing of the present Writ Petition, to mislead the Court: 11.2.1. In its 1* Disclosure Affidavit, despite this Court specifically directing Respondent No. 4 to disclose all assets of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities, Respondent No. 4 only disclosed details in respect of its project ‘Marvel Ribera’. Respondent No. 4 knowing fully well that this was not the only project and/or asset of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities, made a false statement that other than the said project Marvel Ribera, it had no other assets. He submitted that filing of three more Affidavits thereafter by Respondent No. 4 itself shows that the aforesaid statement was false and was made willfully and deliberately in order to mislead this Court at the first instance. 11.2.2. In the 4\" Disclosure Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 has sought to justify its 1“ Disclosure Affidavit by stating that it did not disclose other assets because it was under the impression that disclosure in respect of the project Marvel Ribera and the assets in the said project would be “sufficient” so as to comply with the Order passed by this Court. The 1* Disclosure Affidavit clearly stated that out of 27 flats, 11 had been sold and 16 unsold units were mortgaged. Further it was also stated in the said Affidavit that a sum of Rs. 18,54,05,681/- was receivable from the purchasers of the sold units, but when at the hearing on 14\" January, 2021, this Court enquired whether the said amount had been received, Respondent No. 4’s answer was in the negative. In the aforesaid circumstances, Respondent No. 4 could never have been under the belief that the assets disclosed in the 1* Disclosure were sufficient. 11.2.3. The first three Affidavits filed by Respondent No. 4 only disclosed limited entities and projects and sought to represent to this Court that these were the only entities and projects of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities. However, after the Petitioner pointed out in its Affidavit dated 9\" February, 2021 that Respondent No. 4 had not disclosed various other entities and projects, Respondent No. 4 in the 4\" Disclosure Affidavit admitted that it had disclosed only “major” entities and projects of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities as disclosure with respect to others was “irrelevant”. 11.2.4. In the 4\" Disclosure Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 has stated that it did not disclose assets of projects Marvel Orial, Marvel Fria, Marvel Piazza as the same are “completed” projects. The said statement is belied by the fact that Respondent No. 4 on its official website has represented that these three projects, are ‘ongoing’ projects of Respondent No. 4. 11.2.5. In the 4\" Disclosure Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 has stated that it did not disclose the group entities Marvel Precast Structures India LLP and Marvel Ora Residences LLP as they are not operational. This statement of Respondent No. 4 is belied by the financial statements of these entities produced by the Petitioner which clearly show that in the Financial Year 2019-2020 one of the LLP’s has advanced loan amounts of approximately Rs. 60 crores to its related parties. That it again begs the question how these entities had money to advance such huge loans if they were not operational. 11.3. That these acts of Respondent No. 4 and of Shri Jhavar, in repeatedly disobeying the aforesaid Orders and willfully breaching the undertakings given by it to this Court, amounts to civil contempt, for which the Petitioner may initiate separate proceedings. In addition thereto, the acts of Respondent No. 4 and Shri Jhavar in repeatedly making false and incorrect statements on oath before this Court, in order to interfere with and obstruct the administration of justice, also amounts to contempt in face of the court, as well as perjury. In view thereof, he submitted that Respondent No. 4 and Shri Jhavar ought to be held guilty of contempt and detained in custody. 11.4. That the above submissions are fortified by the Judgment in   5895 - Paras 1 to 22 and 27, wherein a Learned Single Judge of this Court ordered civil imprisonment of the Defendant for a period of three months in view of the Defendant’s deliberate, willful, contumacious conduct in disobeying the Orders passed by the Court, by making false and incorrect statements on oath, thereby obstructing the administration of justice. That like the facts of the present case, in Cipla Limited, supra, the defendant being a Judgment Debtor had been directed by this Court to disclose on oath all his assets (movable and immovable). The defendant filed four successive Affidavits to disclose its assets and in each of the Affidavits, suppressed its assets and did not provide a complete disclosure. In view thereof, this Court held that as the defendant had made false and incorrect statements to the Court, the defendant was guilty of having committed grave and serious act of contempt of this Court. This Order and Judgment was challenged by the Defendant before the Division Bench of this Court in Commercial Appeal No. 18 of 2016. The Division Bench by its Order dated 19 December 2017 Mr.   No. 18 of 2016) - Rel Paras 24, 29 to 37 dismissed the Appeal and upheld the Judgment passed by the Single Judge. The Defendant then challenged the said Order dated 19\" December 2017 by filing SLP (Civil) No. 3872 of 2018 before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court also dismissed the said SLP on 19\" February, 2018 Mr. Krishna Dushyant Rana vs. Cipla Limited - SLP No. 3872 of 2018 and upheld the Order passed by the Single Judge and the Appeal Court. 12. Shri Amit Gharte, Learned Advocate representing Respondent No. 4 made the following submissions : 12.1. That the Petitioner’s contention that Respondent No. 4 has not disclosed its assets and of its group entities is incorrect. 12.2. That when the said Order dated 6 March, 2020 was passed, Respondent No. 4 immediately filed the 1* Disclosure Affidavit disclosing the assets in respect of the project ‘Marvel Ribera’. 12.3. That the said Affidavit was filed under a bona fide belief that as the subject amount involved in the present Writ Petition was approximately Rs. 14,00,00,000/, the said Disclosure that Respondent No. 4 is to receive approximately Rs. 18,00,00,000/- in the said Project from 11 sold flats, would be a sufficient disclosure for the amount involved in the present Writ Petition. 12.4. That on the next occasion i.e. 14\" January, 2021, when it was informed that a detailed disclosure needs to be filed by Respondent No. 4, Respondent No. 4 immediately filed its 2’ Disclosure Affidavit on 20\" January, 2021, which included the chart as to the number of projects and the loans outstanding against the Respondent No. 4 and its group entities. 12.5. That thereafter vide the 3\" and 4\" Disclosure Affidavits, the Respondent No. 4 has in detail disclosed the assets, liabilities, flats sold and unsold, bank details of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities. 12.6. That therefore Respondent No. 4 has to the best of its ability made every effort to comply with the Orders of Disclosures and therefore cannot be held guilty of contempt. 12.7. That it is not the case of any party that the said disclosures filed on record are false or misrepresenting. 12.8. That Respondent No. 4 has not committed any ‘wilful’ breach of any undertaking or statement given to this Court and therefore no contempt action can be initiated against Respondent No. 4. 12.9. That the Supreme Court has in its Judgment in the case of    , inter alia held that a mere disobedience of an order may not be sufficient to amount to a civil contempt within the meaning of Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. The element of willingness is an indispensable requirement to bring home the charge within the meaning of the Contempt Act. 12.10. That if the Petitioner is aggrieved by non-disclosure of complete assets of Respondent No. 4, which according to the Respondent No. 4 has been disclosed, the Petitioner instead of seeking a contempt action, ought to have sought for enforcement of the said Order. That in the case of   (  - Para 18, the Supreme Court has held that for enforcement of the interim and final orders / decree of courts, including undertaking given to the Court, a proper and advisable first mode for enforcement of the order is to file an application seeking enforcement of interim order / undertaking given to the Court, rather than filing a contempt proceeding seeking contempt action. When the matters relate to infringement of a decree or decretal order embodying rights between the parties, contempt jurisdiction cannot be invoked merely because the other remedy would take time; further the contempt jurisdiction is attracted when disobedience of Court’s order or undertaking to the Court is wilful and contumacious (see part C of the Written Arguments of Respondent No. 4). 12.11. That the Supreme Court in   ( , has held that contempt action cannot be used for enforcement of money decree or directions/order for payment of money. That the said principles are also applicable in the facts of the present case and under the garb of contempt proceedings, the enforcement of money decree cannot be ordered. 12.12. That the Petitioner has failed to file any proceedings including contempt proceedings against Respondent No. 4. That neither have the contempt proceedings been preferred, nor this Court has taken suo motu cognizance of any such contempt. Further, no contempt notice has been issued or a show cause notice prior to such contempt notice has been issued to Respondent No. 4 stating the charges and/ or contentions which the present Respondent No. 4 needs to answer. 12.13. That Respondent No. 4 is unaware on what grounds/charges the Petitioner is seeking contempt action against them. That without anything on record / on affidavit, as to under what circumstances and on what grounds the Petitioner is seeking contempt action against Respondent No. 4, the Petitioner cannot merely rely upon a Judgment passed in Cipla Lid.(supra) to seek contempt action. In any event the Judgment in Cipla Lid. arises out of a Summary Suit, which was pending on the Original Side of this Court and the Single Judge was exercising the powers of the Civil Court. Further in paragraph 12, the Single Judge has specifically held that the Defendant had filed a false affidavit and made false statement before the Court, which resulted in the contempt action. That this Court is not exercising jurisdiction of a civil court in its original jurisdiction and the present proceedings are under Article 226 and therefore no contempt proceedings will lie. 12.14. That Chapter XXXIV of the Bombay High Court Rules, Appellate Side, regulates the procedure for initiating contempt action under Article 215 of the Constitution of India and the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. Rules 8, 9, 10, 22 and 24 of the said Rules makes it clear that the reliefs sought by the Petitioner for holding Respondent No. 4 guilty of contempt cannot be granted znter alia unless the Petitioner files a separate application for disobedience of order by Respondent No. 4; a notice is issued to the contemnor by this Court calling upon the contemnor to show cause why no action should be taken against him and Respondent No. 4 is granted 14 days to reply to such Notice. 13. Shri Jagtiani, in rejoinder, submits that the aforesaid Judgment in Anil Sarkar (supra) relied upon by Respondent No. 4 does not support the Respondent No. 4’s contention, as the question whether the disobedience of the order was willful or not is required to be ascertained on the basis of facts of each case. He also submitted that by the Judgments in the case of Kanwar Singh (supra) and Food Corporation of India (supra), the Supreme Court held that contempt jurisdiction cannot be used for enforcement of decree passed in a civil suit as the person had initiated proceedings under Order 39 Rule 2A of the Code of Civil Procedure for breach of a decree, instead of filing execution proceedings under Order 21 Rule 32 of CPC. He submitted that the said ratio is not applicable to the facts in the present case as the Petitioner is not seeking contempt for non-compliance of the decree at all. 13.1. Shri Jagtiani also submitted that the fulfillment of Rules 8, 10, 22 and 24 of the Appellate Side Rules, as relied upon by Respondent No. 4 are not necessary when the contempt is committed in the face of the Court. Shri Jagtiani relied upon Section 14(1) of the Contempt Act read with Rule 4 of the Appellate Side Rules which deal with contempt in the face of the court. ISSUE NO. 2 AS SET OUT IN PARAGRAPH 7.2 14. Shri Sharan Jagtiani, Learned Senior Advocate representing the Petitioner has made the following submissions : 14.1. That in the present case, the Collector and Tahsildar have completely failed to discharge their statutory duties and exercise powers conferred on them under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 (“the Code’) to execute the said Recovery Certificate. That despite receiving the direction from RERA on 15\" April, 2019 to execute the Recovery Certificate, the Tahsildar sent demand notices to Respondent No. 4 only on 11\" September, 2019 and then on 10\" January, 2021, which Respondent No. 4 failed to comply with. Thereafter, the Tahsildar carried out a search of Respondent No. 4’s properties from the property cards available with her. According to the Tahsildar, the Property Cards disclosed names of certain properties in the name of Marvel Imperial Co-operative Housing Society Limited, Marvel Crest Condominium, etc. However, as the names on these Property Cards were not the same as that of Respondent No. 4, i.e. ‘Marvel Sigma Homes Pvt. Ltd.’, she was unable to execute the said Recovery Certificate. That the Property Card annexed, itself shows that Marvel Crest Condominium is owned by Respondent No. 4, which the Tahsildar failed to consider. That instead of exercising the powers conferred on revenue officers under the Code to execute a Recovery Certificate, the Tahsildar vide her Letter dated 11° March, 2020 informed RERA that as she could not locate the properties of Respondent No. 4, she was unable to execute the Recovery Certificate. Thus, it is clear that there has been complete inaction by the Collector and the Tahsildar in complying with their statutory obligations. 14.2. That the events that have transpired during the hearing of the present Writ Petition, clearly show that Respondent No. 4 has no intention of complying with the said Recovery Certificate and/or of paying the said Decretal Amount. That Respondent No. 4 has made every attempt to delay the payment of the said Decretal Amount to the Petitioner. Initially, Respondent No. 4 did not comply with the demand notices of the Tahsildar. Thereafter, once the present Writ Petition was filed, Respondent No. 4 in order to delay the hearing of the present Writ Petition did not provide complete disclosure of its assets and that of its group entities, despite repeated orders passed by this Court. 14.3. That in the various Disclosure Affidavits filed by Respondent No. 4, Respondent No. 4 has sought to represent to this Court that it was debt ridden and had no means to pay the dues of the Petitioner. However, from a perusal of these Disclosure Affidavits, the Petitioner has been able to ascertain that at least an amount of Rs. 2,90,15,211.69/- (Rupees Two Cores Ninety Lakhs Fifteen Thousand Two Hundred Eleven and Sixty-Nine Paisa) is lying in the bank accounts of Respondent No. 4 and its group entities which have no charge on it. There are various other bank accounts as well, which have not been disclosed by Respondent No. 4 and which may also have monies lying therein, which are free of any charge / lien. That as per the list of sold and unsold units in various projects disclosed by Respondent No. 4, there are 192 unsold units in the projects owned by Respondent No. 4 and approximately 449 unsold units in the various projects owned by the group entities of Respondent No. 4. Further, group entities of Respondent No. 4 has been advancing monies to the tune of Rs.60 crores to its related entities, which clearly show that Respondent No. 4 and its group entities have the required funds to pay the Decretal Amount but is with malafide intention avoiding to pay the same. In view thereof, he submitted that Respondent No. 4 despite having the means to pay the said Decretal Amount was refusing to pay the same to the Petitioner. 14.4. That the Supreme Court by its Order dated 12 February, 2021 passed in SLP (C) No. 2122-2123 of 2021, has already upheld the approach of this Court in ensuring that in one manner or the other the Respondent No. 4 honours the decree which has been passed against it. That in view of the aforesaid Order, the interim reliefs as sought by the Petitioner ought to be granted. 14.5. That prayer clauses b (ii) and b (ili) ought to be granted. That the Petitioner apprehends that if the aforesaid interim reliefs are not granted, Respondent No. 4 may deal with all its assets in order to deprive the Petitioner of its undisputed dues. That the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of     - Paras 10 t013 in support of the necessity for grant of interim reliefs in a Writ Petition keeping in mind the ends of justice, is squarely applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case, more particularly to the conduct of Respondent No. 4 in the present case. 14.6. That in exercise of its inherent powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, this Court has the jurisdiction to pass orders and/or directions against a private person and in the present case against Respondent No. 4, which is a Private Limited Company. That the Allahabad High Court in the case of  . Act & Ors.   All 38 - Paras 10 to 18 has held that a High Court, while being seized of a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution, can also pass any order including an order in the nature of an injunction against a private person in exercise of its inherent powers. That while arriving at the aforesaid finding, the Allahabad High Court has relied upon the Judgment of the Supreme Court in     (Coram: K. SUBBA RAO, J.C. SHAH AND S.M. SIKRI, JJ.), wherein the Supreme Court, while considering the scope and ambit of the powers of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution, held that the High Court while exercising its writ jurisdiction can issue any order or direction, which it considers necessary to be issued. 15. Shri Amit Gharte, Learned Advocate representing Respondent No. 4, has made the following submissions : 15.1. That Respondent No. 4 is a Private Limited Company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and does not perform a public function and further does not discharge any public duty and therefore Article 226 of the Constitution of India and the Writ Of Mandamus and/ or any other writ or order or directions cannot be invoked or passed against Respondent No. 4. 15.2. That Respondent No. 4 is governed by RERA and therefore the grievance or action, if any, against Respondent No. 4 has to be within the frame work of RERA. 15.3. The Supreme Court, in its Judgment in the case of   2001 1 SCC 298 - Para 8 and 11, has held that Article 226 can be invoked only when the authority or person performs a public function, or discharges a public duty and not against a private person. 15.4. That the Judgment in Shri Ram Singh (supra) relied upon by the Petitioner is not applicable to the facts of the present case as the same does not specifically deal with issuance of the Writ of Mandamus against a private limited company. 15.5. That interim reliefs sought by the Petitioner will severely affect the projects of the Marvel Group and that the Marvel Group and Respondent No. 4 would be agreeable to the Petitioner selling off the Flat agreed to be purchased by the Petitioner and to retain the sale proceeds in satisfaction of the Recovery Certificate. 16. Shri Jagtiani has distinguished the Judgment relied upon by the Respondent No. 4 in VST Industries (supra) and submitted that the said Judgment relied upon by the Respondent No. 4 has no application in a situation where the final relief is undoubtedly directed against a statutory authority that is a part of the ‘State’ and in aid of that, interim relief is directed against a private party that has benefitted from the inaction of the statutory authority. He submitted that in the present case the Petitioner has not sought issuance of a Writ against the Respondent No. 4, which is a Private Limited Company. 16.1. Without prejudice to the aforesaid, Shri Jagtiani submitted that the said Judgment in VST Industries (supra) does not consider the judgment of the Supreme Court in Dwarka Nath (supra) and is therefore per ncuriam, or at any rate, cannot be relied upon to defeat the grant of interim reliefs. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS : ISSUE NO. 1: “Whether Respondent No. 4 and its Director Shri Jhavar have interfered with the administration of justice by filing false and incorrect affidavits of disclosure and by also violating and breaching various orders of this Court?; If so, the consequences of such breach?” 17.1. The liability of the Respondent No. 4 under the Recovery Certificate is not in dispute. The Recovery Certificate has attained finality. The amount owed to the Petitioner is a repayment of the amount already paid by the Petitioner to Respondent No. 4 for purchase of a flat in its project, and interest on that amount as ordered by the Adjudicating Officer. Thus, the Orders of Disclosure against Respondent No. 4 are a step-in aid of the recovery of this amount, which is sought for in the above Petition filed against Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 for failure to discharge their statutory duties in relating to realising the amount due under the Recovery Certificate. 17.2. Having set out and considered the various Orders and the Affidavits of Disclosure filed by Respondent No. 4, as also the Affidavit of the Petitioner commenting on the lack of disclosure, and having also considered the submissions of both sides on this aspect, we have no hesitation in concluding that Respondent No. 4 and its Director, Shri Jhavar, have wilfully and deliberately breached the Courts Orders. Not only is this a case of wilful disobedience of our Orders but in the facts of this case, such wilful non-compliance and false and incomplete affidavits also tend to interfere with the administration of justice, as these disclosures are necessary to enable us to pass effective orders in the Writ Petition. 17.3. The fact that Respondent No. 4 has filed four Affidavits of Disclosure, all of them in purported compliance of this Court’s Order dated 6\" March, 2020 (and reiterated by the Order of 14° January, 2021), itself indicates that the first three Affidavits, even according to Respondent No. 4, were inadequate and non-compliant. What is relevant to note is the casual manner, in which these Affidavits have been filed in brazen disregard to what was stated in the Orders. For instance, in the 1* Disclosure Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 has only given details of one of the projects of Respondent No. 4, i.e. the subject project ‘Marvel Ribera’. The purported disclosure made qua the subject project was that out of the total 27 flats, 11 flats have been sold and an amount of Rs. 18,54,05,681 was receivable towards sale consideration of the said flats. The remaining 16 flats are unsold, but were mortgaged to ICICI Home Finance Ltd., under a Mortgage Deed dated 29\" May, 2017. Further in paragraph 7 of the 1° Disclosure Affidavit, Respondent No. 4 made a statement that, “Marvel Sigma Homes Private Limited apart from above has no other property”. Details of other projects of Respondent No. 4 or of any of the group entities were not disclosed. In the 4\" Disclosure Affidavit, at paragraph 2, there is an attempt to justify this by saying that details of other projects were not disclosed since Respondent No. 4 was under the impression that the amount of assets including receivables disclosed by Respondent No. 4 in the 1* Disclosure Affidavit would be sufficient to comply with the Court’s Order dated 6\" March, 2020 (wrongly referred to as 4\" March, 2020). 17.4. The above stand of Respondent No. 4 is belied by the fact that after the 1“ Disclosure Affidavit was filed, in response to the Court’s query as to realisation of the receivable of Rs. 18,54,05,681/-, Respondent No. 4 told the Court that this amount has not been received and no indication was given as to when this amount would in fact be received. In fact, no particulars of this substantial amount of receivables were disclosed in any of the later Affidavits especially when the 4 and last Disclosure Affidavit was filed on 12\" February, 2021 and the 1“ Disclosure Affidavit was filed on 12\" March, 2020. Despite this, Respondent No. 4 seeks to justify its breach in the 1* Disclosure Affidavit by suggesting that what was disclosed was sufficient. That apart, the determination of whether a disclosure is sufficient or not, is not to be made by the party who is ordered to make disclosures by the Court-when the terms of the Order seeking disclosure are clear and categorical. Thus, the conduct of wilful breach and obstruction commenced with the 1* Disclosure Affidavit which was sought to be justified by the Respondent No. 4 even after about a year, by which time the Respondent No. 4 was obviously aware that the Court was not satisfied with the disclosures made. 17.5. The conduct of Respondent No. 4 in not taking responsibility to ensure full compliance with our Orders stood exposed from the statement made in the 3™ Disclosure Affidavit namely, “J say that since the Respondent No. 4 and its other companies are vast, there might be some of the assets/ projects, which inadvertently are not stated in the Affidavits, the Respondent No. 4 crave leave of Hon’ble Court to put the said properties on affidavits if the same is pointed out to us.” (Emphasis Supplied) 17.6. We are therefore of the view that such an Affidavit is unacceptable and a clear indication that Respondent No. 4 had no intention to make serious efforts to comply with our Orders as noted above. In fact, as the 4\" Disclosure Affidavit demonstrates, the reason for not making full disclosures in the earlier Affidavits is not because Respondent No. 4 or its Director could not access details of Respondent No. 4’s projects and assets of those of its group entities, but because Respondent No. 4 and Shri Jhavar only chose to make disclosure of assets of “major” entities and projects that they regarded as relevant. This is in complete breach of our Orders, which are clear and unqualified qua the disclosure that was required to be made. 17.7. We are also in agreement with the submission of the Petitioner that the false and incomplete disclosures up to the filing of the 3 Disclosure Affidavit have been highlighted in the Petitioner’s Affidavit dated 9 February, 2021. The contents and submissions in relation to this Affidavit of 9°\" February, 2021 have been set out and discussed in the foregoing paragraphs and the same are therefore not reproduced herein. However, it is pertinent to note that up to the filing of the 3\" Disclosure Affidavit, the disclosures of various group entities had not been made. Some of those group entities appear to be developing ongoing projects. In other instances, they have completed projects, and would therefore in all probability have unsold inventory. Other group entities, such as Marvel Precast Structures LLP and Marvel Ora Residences LLP, appear to have assets in the form of receivables of loans advanced by them. In the case of Marvel Ora Residences, the amount loaned by it is substantial, being about Rs. 59.99 crores. This disclosure is relevant since it indicates that the group entities have funds and resources or access to funds and resources which are being used to finance other group entities rather than the Marvel Group discharging its liability to persons such as the Petitioner. At this stage, however, what is more important to note is the fact that these disclosures were never made by the Respondent No. 4 and were brought to light by the Petitioner in its Affidavit of 9\" February, 2021. 17.8. The other important aspect of the non-disclosure is what is set out in paragraphs 26 and 27 of the Petitioner’s Affidavit dated 9\" February, 2021. This is in relation to various projects that have not been disclosed, including those of the seven entities in respect of which some disclosure was made by Respondent No. 4. The details of these projects have already been listed above. The Petitioner has relied upon the Website of the Marvel Group being available at the url: www.marvelrealtors.com. The Petitioner has then also placed on record the entities and projects in relation to which no bank account details and disclosures have been made. 17.9. Respondent No. 4 has attempted to justify its non-disclosures in its 4\" Disclosure Affidavit dated 12\" February, 2021, the contents of which have also been set out above. In paragraph 3, Respondent No. 4 has stated that the non-disclosure of bank account details of various projects is because most of the projects are complete. A list of those supposedly completed projects is then given. The fact that a project is complete is no reason to not disclose it. It is possible that even for a complete project, there may be unsold inventory and the bank accounts maintained would be a relevant part of any disclosure. 17.10. Moreover, the Petitioner has correctly pointed out by relying upon the Website of the Marvel Group that certain projects namely, Marvel Orial, Marvel Fria, Marvel Piazza and Marvel Selva Ridge, are in fact ongoing projects and not ‘complete’. The relevant extracts of the Website of the Respondent No. 4 / the Marvel group are reproduced below : IMAGE Thus, it can be seen that the statements made by Respondent No. 4 are clearly false to its own knowledge and contrary to the information that Respondent No. 4 is providing to the public at large in relation to its own business. 17.11. We are also of the view that the reason for not filing disclosure of the entities mentioned in paragraph 4 of the 4 Disclosure Affidavit, by describing it as irrelevant, because disclosure of major group entities had been made, is wholly untenable. As has been noted above, the Petitioner’s response to this part of Respondent No. 4’s Affidavit also establishes that at least some of those entities had assets or unsold inventory that were substantial and had to be disclosed. We reiterate that it is not for Respondent No. 4 to unilaterally decide what is relevant and irrelevant in complying with an Order of Disclosure. As already pointed out, the current assets (including receivables from the short-term loans advanced) of Marvel Ora Residences LLP are very substantial and clearly indicate that the Marvel Group has access to funds, the source of which is not being disclosed. As noted in the context of the Petitioner’s Affidavit of 9\" February, 2021, even some of the other group entities have assets, which Respondent No. 4 never disclosed, because it described them as ‘irrelevant’ and outside the category of ‘major’ entities. 17.12. In view of what is set out above, it would be relevant to set out the observations of a Single Judge of this Court in C7pla Limited, (supra). “1. This is one of those matters where the court is anguished with the conduct of the defendant who despite being given repeated opportunity has repeatedly abused the liberty granted by the court. It is rather unfortunate that the defendant, who ts probably in his 30's at least from the appearance, if let off to continue with his behaviour, it will erode the faith that the public have on judiciary. The rule of law is premised upon the faith reposed by the people in the justice delivery system. To prevent erosion of that faith contemptuous behaviour in the face of the court needs a strict treatment. 18. The defendant has made false and incorrect statements and has given undertaking to this Court that he has disclosed every asset that he has, knowing the same to be false and incorrect. I am satisfied that the defendant is guilty of having committed grave and serious act of contempt of this Court. This court gave a very long rope to the defendant to come out clean, to come out honest, to come out truthful and be transparent to the court but every opportunity given has been abused by the defendant. Repeatedly false statements have been made. The attempt ts to drag on the matter so that the defendant can get away. The conduct of the defendant has scandalized and lowered the dignity of the court in the eyes of the public. The action of the defendant has been deliberate, unlawful and purposely done with a view to mislead the court, by making deliberate, false, misleading and incorrect statements. In Advocate General, High Court of Karnataka v. Chidambara, the Karnataka High Court has also held that any person who makes a false statement on oath would be interferring with the administration of justice. 19. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case of Re: Bineet Kumar Sing v. Unknown has in clear terms held that a false or misleading or wrong statement deliberately and willfully made by a party to the proceedings would undoubtedly tantamount to interference with the due course of judicial proceeding. 20. Inthe present case the conduct of the defendant clearly brings to light the fact that the defendant has no respect for this Court. It clearly shows that the defendant feels that making false statements including undertaking to the courts and thereafter breaching them or not complying with the directions given by the Court would have no consequences. The conduct of the defendant is willful, deliberate and contumacious. The Supreme Court in Leela David ». State of Maharashtra, in clear terms that the court is not precluded from taking recourse to summary proceeding when a deliberate contempt takes place and the punishment is given forthwith by the court on holding the contumacious guilt of contempt and sending them to prison. 21. In   it is stated the law should not be seen to sit by limply, while those who defy it go free, and those who seek its protection lose hope. It is also settled that a course of conduct which abuses and makes a mockery of the judicial process and which thus extends its pernicious influence beyond the parties to the action and affects the interest of the public in the administration of justice needs a strict treatment. 22. The defendant has made a mockery of the judicial process. A decree has been passed against the defendant way back in 2011. The chamber summons was taken out for the reliefs as mentioned above. Even though the chamber summons was served upon the defendant in September-2013, the defendant did not file any reply until June-2015. Even in the affidavit in reply, t.e., first affidavit, he does not disclose the entire truth about all the assets in his name. Still he states in the end of the affidavit that he has disclosed everything. When he was given another chance to explain, he files second affidavit in which, again, he does not disclose all the assets but still makes a statement that he has disclosed all movable and immovable assets to the court. But when the annual returns which were annexed to the second affidavit was considered, it came to light that he had other assets in his name which have not been disclosed in his affidavit. 3rd opportunity and 4th opportunity was given to the defendant and he filed third affidavit dated 13.7.2015 and fourth affidavit dated 8.9.2015 but still chose to be economical with truth. When the court asked him as to how he paid the loan taken for the two skoda cars, the defendant's counsel on instructions from the defendant stated first it was paid by cash and then it was changed to one car in cash and other in cheque and again it was changed to everything by cheque from Cosmos bank, but there is no mention of Cosmos bank in any of the documents. At every stage whenever affidavits were filed, the defendant was made aware that he should be truthful in his affidavit. The defendant was also aware that he had to disclose all the assets and that is why in the affidavits he has been signing off by saying ‘I disclosed my all movable and immovable assets’. He had stated that right in the first affidavit. If that was true, there would not have been a need to file the second affidavit in which also he has stated he has disclosed all assets. But still he had to file third and fourth affidavit. Therefore, the defendant knew all the time that he was making false statement before the court in the form of affidavits and in effect was making a mockery of the judicial process. The opportunity given to file further affidavit was misused and abused. The conduct of the defendant was contumacious because he could not care. His demeanor has been that he could make false statements, give undertakings to the court and breach them and it would have no consequences. The action of the defendant has been deliberate, willful and purposely done with a view to completely mislead this court. By making false statement on oath, knowing it to be false statement, the defendant has interfered with the administration of justice. In my view, tf this conduct of the defendant is not dealt with firmly, that may result in scandalizing the institution and lowering its dignity in the eyes of the public. 25. In view of the above, I hold the defendant has disobeyed the orders made under Order XXTI Rule 41(2) of the code of civil procedure. 27. In view of the deliberate willful contumacious conduct of the defendant and thereby obstructing the administration of justice, the defendant deserves to be detained in civil prison for three months, the maximum period provided.” 17.13. As mentioned above, the Order and Judgment of the Single Judge was confirmed by a Division Bench and thereafter by the Supreme Court. Although, the Judgment in C7pla (supra) was in the context of consequences of non-disclosure under Order 21 Rule 41(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (‘CPC’), the Judgment itself also relies upon the general principles that are fundamental to the rule of law. The Judgment (which in turn refers to various other relevant decisions of the Supreme Court and other Courts) clearly supports the proposition that such brazen and continuous disregard for orders of the Court including by making false and misleading statements would also obstruct and interfere with the administration of justice. This entitles the Court in a given case to take recourse to summary proceedings when a deliberate contempt takes place and the punishment is given forthwith by the Court. 17.14. We are in agreement with the views expressed in C7pla (supra). We also find that the Judgments relied upon by the Respondent No. 4 in the case of Anil Sarkar (supra) is of no relevance and renders no assistance to Respondent No. 4. For the reasons noted above, we find that the breach and non-compliance of our Orders by Respondent No. 4 was indeed wilful and deliberate and did affect the administration of justice. It was not a case where there was one infraction and thereafter Respondent No. 4 complied with our Orders. 17.15. The Judgments in Kanwar Singh Saini (supra) and Food Corporation of India (supra) relied upon by the Respondent No. 4 to contend that the Court ought to exercise discretion when exercising powers under the Contempt of Courts Act and that the contempt jurisdiction ought not to be used for enforcement of a decree where proceedings in enforcement have been initiated, are equally of no assistance to the Respondent No. 4. 17.16. Although these are not proceedings under the Contempt of Courts Act, it would be entirely within the jurisdiction and power of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, to deal with the very serious issue of Respondent No. 4’s wilful disobedience and interference in the administration of justice by deliberately not complying with the various Orders of Disclosure made by this Court from time to time, and by filing false and incomplete Affidavits. As regards the exercise of discretion, before taking such action, we may note that we have given several opportunities to Respondent No. 4 to comply with our Orders. There is also no merit in the submission that contempt proceedings are not a substitute for proceedings for execution or enforcement. This submission is of no relevance in the present case, where the grievance of the Petitioner is that the statutory authorities are taking no steps to ensure recovery of the amounts under the Recovery Certificate, because of which the present Petition has been filed. The issue of Respondent No. 4’s wilful breach and interference with the administration of justice has come up because of its conduct, in the course of this very Writ Petition. Thus, there is absolutely no merit in the submission of Respondent No. 4 by relying on the above Judgments. 17.17. This takes us to the question as to what action ought to be taken against Respondent No. 4 and its Director Shri Jhavar, who, being an executive Director of Respondent No. 4, has affirmed all the Affidavits of Respondent No. 4. Though we would have been justified in forthwith considering Shri Jhavar’s conduct as being interference in the administration of justice for all the reasons noted above, we are instead inclined to take suo moto cognizance of Respondent No. 4 and Shri Jhavar’s conduct, and direct that a Notice be issued to Respondent No. 4 and Shri Jhavar under Section 14 of the Contempt of Courts Act read with Rule 4 of the Appellate Side Rules, 1960, and call upon Respondent No. 4 and Shri Jhavar to respond as to why Shri Jhavar should not be punished under the aforesaid provisions for obstruction and interference with the administration of justice and lowering the dignity of this Court. Such Notice will be issued by the Appellate Side Registry of the Bombay High Court. All proceedings in relation to such Notice will be in accordance with the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act and the Appellate Side Rules. Our observations as above may be considered relevant only for the purposes of our decision to take suo moto cognizance and for issuance of the said Notice to Respondent No. 4 and Shri Jhavar. 17.18. Independent of the above, the Petitioner will be at liberty to institute proceedings for civil contempt under the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, if so advised. 17.19. For all of the above reasons we answer the first issue as set out above in the affirmative and the consequences of our conclusion are as set out hereinabove. ISSUE NO. 2 : Whether the Petitioner is entitled to the interim reliefs as set out in prayer clauses (b)(ii) and (b)(ili) of the present Writ Petition, especially considering that Respondent No. 4 is a Private Limited Company? 18. As regards grant of interim reliefs prayed for, the following two questions arise for our consideration : \"i) whether a prima facie case has been made out against Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 for non-performance of their statutory duties under the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, for realisation and recovery of the amount under the Recovery Certificate; ii) whether Respondent No. 4, being a Private Limited Company, can be subjected to interim reliefs in exercise of our writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.\" 18.1. Having considered the material on record, we are prima facie satisfied, that Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have done nothing in discharge of their statutory duties to secure recovery of the Decretal Amounts under the Recovery Certificate. Although the Tahsildar issued a demand notice dated 11\" September, 2019, no steps were taken especially considering that Respondent No. 4 did not reply to the notice. There are powers available to the Tahsildar under the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, inter alia under Section 263 and Section 267 read with Rule 17 of the Maharashtra Realisation of Land Revenue Rules, 1967, to facilitate such recovery. No steps were taken pursuant to the powers available under these provisions. The Tahsildar did absolutely nothing thereafter, despite the Petitioner addressing letters to the Tahsildar to take steps for making the recovery under the Recovery Certificate. 18.2. The Affidavit filed by Respondent No. 3 - Tahsildar dated 6\" March, 2020 is itself an indication that there was complete and unjustified inaction on her part. We have already reproduced hereinabove paragraphs 6 and 7 of this Affidavit. The stand of the Tahsildar essentially is that since in the Property Card there is no project or property that bears the name of Respondent No. 4, no action for recovery could be taken. In fact, the Property Card annexed to the Affidavit of 6 March, 2020 itself indicates that Marvel Crest is a project of Respondent No. 4 - Marvel Sigma Homes Pvt. Ltd. Despite this, no steps were taken by the Tahsildar even in respect of the project Marvel Crest. This shows a complete lack of effort and application of mind by the office of Tahsildar in discharging its statutory duty. 18.3. It is pertinent to note that after filing the Affidavit dated 6\" March, 2020, the Tahsildar addressed a letter to RERA on 11\" March, 2020 that she could not locate the properties of Respondent No. 4 and was unable to execute the Recovery Certificate. We have already referred to this letter above. The same establishes complete failure and abdication of duties by the Tahsildar. In fact, as on the date of writing this letter, the Tahsildar had done nothing to secure the execution and realisation of monies due under the Recovery Certificate. This letter is yet another indication that the Tahsildar was not interested in ensuring realisation of the amount under the Recovery Certificate. 18.4. Respondent No. 4 contended that Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are now taking steps and that the Tahsildar has, on 8\" February, 2021, levied a charge on Respondent No. 4’s property for Rs. 6.25 crores at 30/A Boat Club Road Pune. We find that this solitary measure during the pendency of the Writ Petition, and that too after gross inaction and abdication of duty, is not enough to satisfy us that Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 are taking the necessary steps in accordance with law. It is not the contention of Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 that the Petition ought to be dismissed in view of the steps taken by them. Their Affidavit on record shows that they have pleaded helplessness in ensuring recovery of the amounts due under the Recovery Certificate. It is not for Respondent No. 4 to make a self-serving submission that the actions taken by Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 against Respondent No. 4 itself are enough to satisfy this Court. For these reasons, we find that a strong prima facie case has been made out in this Writ Petition to consider the grant of interim reliefs. 18.5. The next aspect that requires consideration is the contention of Respondent No. 4 that being a Private Limited Company or entity, no reliefs can be granted against it in a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. This submission has been made in the Written Submissions filed on behalf of Respondent No. 4. Much after the application for interim reliefs was reserved for Orders, Respondent No. 4 filed yet another Interim Application being IA (Stamp) No. 11023 of 2021 on 21% May, 2021. The same came to be listed before us on 15\" June, 2021. By this Interim Application (‘IA’), Respondent No. 4 sought to raise this very issue which was already argued by it as a preliminary issue affecting the maintainability of the Writ Petition. By our Order dated 15\" June, 2021 we disposed of this IA by stating that the issue of grant of reliefs against a private entity such as Respondent No. 4 will be considered by us, as the same had been raised by Respondent No. 4. 18.6. In considering this submission or opposition to grant of interim reliefs against Respondent No. 4, it is to be noted that the final reliefs in the Writ Petition seek a Mandamus against Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 to exercise their statutory duties and take effective steps for the realisation of the amount due and payable to the Petitioner under the Recovery Certificate. It is not the case of any of the Respondents including Respondent No. 4 that the Writ Petition seeking such a Writ of Mandamus is not maintainable or is misconceived. The maintainability of the Writ Petition must be determined with reference to the final reliefs that are sought, and we have no doubt that such a Writ Petition would be maintainable under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. 18.7. It is well settled that grant of interim reliefs is in aid of final reliefs in any proceeding, such as a Writ Petition or a Suit. In the present case, the interim reliefs in terms of prayer clauses (b)(ii) and (b)(iii), which are directed against Respondent No. 4 (for deposit and injunction) and its assets, as also assets of its group entities, are clearly in aid of the final reliefs seeking action by the statutory authorities for realisation of the undisputed amounts under the Recovery Certificate. In the wide and extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, there would be no embargo, or restriction on the grant of interim reliefs against an errant private party in aid of the final reliefs prayed for in the Writ Petition. The Court will of course have to be mindful, of the facts and circumstances in a given case, of whether a private law action is being substituted by exercise of a writ remedy. That is not the case here, since the Petitioner in the present case has already obtained an Order from the Adjudicating Officer constituted under the RERA Act for repayment of the amounts paid by the Petitioner with interest. That has, in turn, led to a Recovery Certificate. It is the failure to act in relation to that Recovery Certificate that has led to this Writ Petition and the interim reliefs sought for. If the interim reliefs as sought for by the Petitioner are not granted, it is extremely likely or possible that Respondent No. 4 and its group entities will deal with, or further encumber or mortgage their assets and there will be no prospect or possibility of realisation under the Recovery Certificate. The conduct of Respondent No. 4 and its Director as noted above, justifies such apprehension. 18.8. We see merit in the reliance placed by the Petitioner on the Judgment of the Allahabad High Court in Shri Ram Singh (supra) which in turn relies upon and reproduces the relevant extract from the Supreme Court decision in Dwarka Nath (supra). The relevant paragraphs of the Judgment are reproduced hereunder : “10. But as regards the second question as to whether the appellate or revisional order passed by a district court 1s amenable to a writ jurisdiction, the Full Bench in Ganga Saran's case has held as under. “With respect to the second question to be answered by us, we are not inclined to deal with it elaborately here. Suffice it to say that the view of the Supreme Court in Qamaruddin's case (supra) that ordinarily an interlocutory order passed in civil suit is not amenable to extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution, no doubt is based upon recognised principle taken into consideration by the court in refusing the writ. In our opinion, this view of the Supreme Court in Qamaruddin's case is based on assumption that a revision under S. 115, CPC to High Court is maintainable and the party aggrieved can invoke revisional jurisdiction of the High Court. But in a situation where a revision ts barred against the appellate or revisional order passed by the district courts and said order suffers from patent error of law and further causes manifest injustice to the party aggrieved can tt be said that such an order is not amenable to extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution. In our opinion, although everyinterlocutory order passed in civil suit is not subject to review under Art. 226 of the Constitution but if it is found from the order impugned that fundamental principle of law has been violated and further that such an order causes substantial injustice to the party aggrieved, the view taken by the Supreme Court in Qamaruddin's case (supra) will not preclude such a writ being issued by the High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution. But only such writ petition under Art. 226 or 227 of the Constitution would be maintainable where writ can be issued within the ambit of the well-established and recognised principles laid down by the Supreme Court as well as by the various High Courts in that regard. The opinion expressed by the Supreme Court in Qamaruddin's case (supra) to the extent that a writ of mandamus cannot be issued to a private individual unless he is under statutory duty to perform a duty is in accord with well established principle regarding writ of certiorari and mandamus and need no reiteration or elaboration at our hand............ Where an aggrieved party approaches High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution against an order passed in civil suit refusing to issue injunction to a private individual who is not under statutory duty to perform public duty or vacating an order of injunction, the main relief is for issue of a writ of mandamus to a private individual and such a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution would not be maintainable. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in Qamaruddin's case (supra) this court cannot issue a writ of mandamus to a private party unless he is under a statutory duty to perform a public duty.” (Emphasis supplied) 11. From the above passage quoted from Ganga Saran's case (supra) it is evident that so far as maintainability of writ of certiorari against the impugned order is concerned, it is not in doubt. It ts also not in doubt that a writ of mandamus against the subordinate courts is maintainable. What is in doubt is whether a writ of mandamus against a private person can be issued if such private person is not under any statutory obligations to perform a public duty for the performance of which a writ of mandamus is normally issued. 12. In  ,  , the Supreme Court while considering the scope and ambit of powers of High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution, has made the following observations (at page 84): “This Article is couched in comprehensive phraseology and it ex facie confers a wide power on the High Court to reach injustice wherever it is found. The Constitution designedly uses a wide language in describing the nature of power, the purpose for such and the person or authority against whom it can be exercised. It can issue writs in the nature of prerogative writs as understood in England but the scope of those writ petitions also is widened by the use of the expression ‘nature’ for the said expression does not equate the writ petition that can be issued in India with those in England but only draws an analogy from them. That apart, High Courts can also issue directions, orders or writs other than the prerogative writs. It enables the High Courts to mould the relief to meet peculiar and complicated requirements of the country, any attempt to equate the scope of the power of High Courts under Art. 226 of the Constitution with that of the English Courts to issue prerogative writs is to introduce an unnecessary procedural restrictions grown over the years in a comparatively small country like England with a unitary form of Government to a vast country like India functioning under a federal structure. Such construction defeats the purpose of Article itself.” 13. The above observations of the Supreme Court in Dwaritka Nath's case (supra) tend to support the view that a writ in the nature of mandamus may be issued against a private individual in view of the language of wide amplitude of Art. 226 is couched with. It is no doubt true that a writ jurisdiction under Art. 226 of the Constitution is in the nature of supervisory jurisdiction and not appellate one and that it is not a substitute for the ordinary remedies available under the normal law of the land and the High Court may under Art. 226 decline to interfere if an equally efficacious alternative remedy is available. The remedy for injunction ts available under the Civil P.C. and the Specific Relief Act 1963 but this is only a self imposed restriction. There ts no absolute bar. It is a question of discretion to be exercised on sound principles of law, justice and equity. Whether to grant or not to grant an ad interim injunction is certainly a matter involving the exercise of judgment and discretion of the subordinate Civil Courts and the High Court may not interfere in the matter but in its supervisory jurisdiction under Art. 226 of the Constitution, the High Court can certainly see whether the orders passed by the Subordinate courts suffer from any error of jurisdiction, patent illegality or perversity etc. and I am also of the opinion that the High Court while exercising its writ jurisdiction against an appellate or revisional order can issue a writ of certiorart/mandamus not only against the subordinate courts but it may also issue any order or direction, not necessarily in the nature of a writ, which it considers necessary to be issued in order to effectuate its certiorari jurisdiction. 14. Iam also of the opinion that the High Court while seized of a writ petition under Art. 226 of the Const. can also pass any order including an order in the nature of injunction against a private individual in exercise of tts inherent powers. In  , Vasco Digama, Goa  , his Lordship (R.M. Sahai, J.) of the Supreme Court in his concurring judgment has observed that “Art. 225 of the Constitution preserved jurisdiction including inherent jurisdiction which existed on the date the Constitution came into force and Art. 226 enlarged it by making it not only the custodian of fundamental rights of a citizen but as a repository power to reach its arms to do justice................ The High Courts in India being courts of unlimited jurisdiction, repository of all judicial power under the Constitution except what ts excluded, are competent to issue directions for arrest of foreign ship in exercise of statutory jurisdiction or even otherwise to effectuate the exercise of jurisdiction.” 15. Since the order impugned in this writ petition is amenable to certiorari jurisdiction of the High Court, it can safely be said, on the basis of the above quoted observations of the Supreme Court in M.V. Elisabeth case (supra), that while exercising certiorari jurisdiction, the High Courts may not only demolish the erroneous orders passed by subordinate courts and direct them to perform their judicial duties in accordance with law but it can also issue orders or directions which may be considered necessary to be passed in order to “effectuate” its certiorari/mandamus jurisdiction. Such a course is open not only on the strength of Art. 226 of the Constitution, but also on the dint of Art. 225 of the Constitution which makes the High Court a Court of record having inherent jurisdiction in exercise of which jurisdiction, the High Court can, in my opinion, issue an order or direction in the nature of an injunction even against a private individual. Decision of the Supreme Court in Qamaruddin's case and that of the Full Bench in Ganga Saran's case (supra) do not, in my judgment, create any hindrance in the way of the High Court passing an order in the nature of an injunction in exercise of tts inherent jurisdiction if it considers necessary to do so while disposing of the writ petition in order to effectuate its certiorari/mandamus jurisdiction against the subordinate courts or tribunals. The observations to the contrary in Qamaruddin's case (supra) Vere made in a different context and various aspects of High Court's power as examined in Dwaraka Nath's and Elisabeth's cases (supra) were not considered in Qamaruddin's case nor was the question examined from this angle in Ganga Saran's case.” 18.9. Our leaning towards granting interim reliefs is also supported by the dictum of the Supreme Court in the case of Deoraj (supra). We have noted that the Supreme Court has observed that in a given case, the failure to grant interim reliefs, even if they may be mandatory in nature, would defeat the ends of justice. It would be relevant to set out the said observations of the Supreme Court as under: “11. The Courts and tribunals seized of the proceedings within their jurisdiction take a reasonable time in disposing of the same. This ts on account of fair-procedure requirement which involves delay intervening between the previous and the next procedural steps leading towards preparation of case for hearing. Then, the courts are also overburdened and their hands are full. As the conclusion of hearing on merits is likely to take some time, the parties press Jor interim relief being granted in the interregnum. An order of interim relief may or may not be a reasoned one but the factors of prima facie case, irreparable injury and balance of convenience do work at the back of the mind of the one who passes an Order of interim nature. Ordinarily, the court is inclined to maintain status quo as obtaining on the date of the commencement of the proceedings. However, there are a few cases which call for the court’s leaning not in favour of maintaining the status quo and still lesser in percentage are the cases when an order tantamounting to a mandamus is required to be issued even at an interim stage. There are matters of significance and of moment posing themselves as moment of truth. Such cases do cause dilemma and put the wits of any judge to test. 12. Situations emerge where the granting of an interim relief would tantamount to granting the final relief itself: And then there may be converse cases where withholding of an interim relief would tantamount to dismissal of the main petition itself; for, by the time the main matter comes up for hearing there would be nothing left to be allowed as relief to the Petitioner though all the findings may be in his favour. In such cases the availability of a very strong prima facie case - of a standard much higher than just prima facie case, the considerations of balance of convenience and irreparable injury forcefully tilting the balance of the case totally in favour of the applicant may persuade the court to grant an interim relief though it amounts to granting final relief itself. Of course, such would be rare and exceptional cases. The court would grant such an interim relief only if satisfied that withholding of it would prick the conscience of the court and do violence to the sense of justice, resulting in ingustice being perpetuated throughout the hearing, and at the end the court would not be able to vindicate the cause of justice. Obviously such would be rare cases accompanied by compelling circumstances, where the injury complained of ts immediate and pressing and would cause extreme hardship. The conduct of the parties shall also have to be seen and the court may put the parties on such terms as may be prudent.” 18.10. Respondent No. 4 has in response, relied upon the Supreme Court Judgment in the case of VST Industries Lid. (supra) to contend that no reliefs can be granted against Respondent No. 4. This Judgment is of no assistance to Respondent No. 4 and has no application in the present case. VST Industries Lid. was a case where the final relief in a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India sought a writ of mandamus against the Appellant (Original Respondent) to treat the members of the respondent union (original petitioner), who are employees of the canteen of the appellant’s factory, as employees of the Appellant, and for grant of monetary and other consequential benefits. The Supreme Court observed that the appellant was a private entity involved in the business of manufacturing cigarettes and was a private party that was not discharging any public function or duty. In its discussion the Supreme Court also observed that a writ under Article 226 of the Constitution of India may lie against a private body in relation to discharge of a public duty. However, the Court stated that the obligation to maintain a canteen for welfare of its employees under Section 46 of the Factories Act, 1948, would not mean that the Appellant is discharging any public function so as to make it amenable to a writ of mandamus at the instance of the respondent labour union seeking absorption of its workers as employees of the Appellant. It is for these reasons that the Supreme Court held that the Single Judge and the Division Bench fell into error that the Appellant was amenable to writ jurisdiction. Interestingly, even after holding this, the Supreme Court did not interfere with the order of the High Court on merits. 18.11. The Judgment in VST Industries Lid., is wholly distinguishable and has no bearing on the issue that arises in the present Petition. In the present case, and as noted above, a Writ of Mandamus is sought against Respondent Nos. 2 and 3, who are statutory authorities and clearly amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. We have already expressed our prima facie findings as to their failure to discharge statutory duties and responsibilities. This was clearly not the case in VST Industries Ltd., where the final relief of mandamus was sought only against a private entity that was held not to be discharging a public function or duty in relation to the subject matter of the dispute. Once we hold that the present Writ Petition is clearly maintainable and justified, it is certainly within the extraordinary and inherent jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to protect the rights and interests of the Petitioner by granting interim relief even against a private party Respondent that has wrongly benefitted from the inaction on the part of the public authorities in discharge of their public duty. In fact, this issue did not arise for consideration in the case of VST Industries Ltd. Thus, we hold that the Judgment of the Supreme Court in VST Industries Lid. extends no help / assistance to the Respondent No. 4. 18.12. Additionally, this submission of Respondent No. 4 to dismiss the Writ Petition against them, or to not grant interim reliefs against them, because they are a private entity is also contrary to the clear terms of the Order of the Supreme Court dated 12\" February, 2021, dismissing Respondent No. 4’s Special Leave Petition against this Courts Order dated 6™ March, 2020 and 14\" January, 2021. Both those Orders directed disclosure against Respondent No. 4 and its group companies. The Supreme Court not only dismissed the Special Leave Petitions but categorically went on to observe that, “we give our full imprimatur to the approach adopted by the High Court to ensure that in one manner or the other the petitioner honours decree which has been passed against him.” To refuse interim reliefs, for the reasons contended by Respondent No. 4, would be contrary to the very approach that has been approved by the Supreme Court. 18.13. Keeping in mind our above findings and the Order of the Supreme Court, we are of the view that a case has been made out for grant of interim reliefs, as prayed for against Respondent No. 4. From the Affidavits of Disclosure filed, it appears that Respondent No. 4 has 192 unsold units across its various projects being, Marvel Kyra (90 unsold units); Marvel Arco (2 unsold units); Marvel Bounty (18 unsold units); Marvel Sera (66 unsold units); Marvel Ribera (16 unsold units). This position may have changed as on date, but the status of unsold units of Respondent No. 4 can be readily ascertained from the RERA Website. 18.14. Accordingly, Respondent No. 4 is restrained by an order of injunction from selling, transferring, further encumbering, or alienating, or creating any further third-party rights in respect of its unsold units as on the date of uploading of this Order. The monies lying to the credit of the bank accounts in respect of these projects, or to the credit of the general bank accounts of Respondent No. 4, shall not be used except in the ordinary course of business. 18.15. As regards the prayer for injunction against the group companies, it is clear from the material placed before us that the Marvel Group has held itself out to be a single economic unit and that its projects are owned and operated or developed by various entities within the group. There has been no dispute that the various other entities that have been referred to in the Affidavits of Disclosure are indeed group entities of Respondent No. 4. This Court’s approach in seeking disclosure of even group companies’ assets has been approved by the Supreme Court. It is common for developers to set up different companies or special purpose vehicles to undertake projects as part of the development business of the group as a whole. 18.16. Prima facie we are of the view that recovery of monies under the Recovery Certificate, would in the facts and circumstances of the present case, also be permissible against the assets of group companies, especially if the non-payment of a clear undisputed amount is being illegally and dishonestly avoided, whilst at the same time very large sums of money are being raised and spent by the same group for carrying on large real estate development projects. To allow such persons to defeat and frustrate the recovery of monies by individual purchasers and at the same time, permit them to carry on their business as usual, would clearly undermine the rule of law and shake the confidence of the public at large. 18.17. From the disclosures made in the 3™ Disclosure Affidavits at Annexure 1, there are about 379 unsold units of the group companies/entities (other than Respondent No. 4) in different projects. The present position of unsold units for the projects undertaken by group companies will be as per the status on the RERA Website. In relation to the group companies that have been disclosed the order of injunction will operate only to the extent of those unsold units, if any, that are not encumbered or mortgaged. If those group companies intend to sell any of their unencumbered units they will have the liberty to apply to this Court, so that this Court may pass protective orders in respect of such sale proceeds. 18.18. Further, we direct Respondent No. 4 to deposit in this Court a sum of Rs. 11,36,33,625/- being the principal sum owed to the Petitioner, within four weeks from the date of uploading of this Order. If such deposit is made, the order of injunction as ordered above will stand vacated. The Petitioner would be at liberty to seek withdrawal of this amount in part satisfaction of the Recovery Certificate. As regards the Petitioner’s claim for interest at 10.05% (p.a.) of the amount stipulated in the Recovery Certificate, the same is effectively secured by the Tahsildar’s charge by its Letter dated 8\" February, 2021 on Respondent No. 4’s land for the sum of Rs. 6.5 crores. The Tahsildar will not vacate that charge without the leave of this Court. Further, the Tahsildar ought to take steps in relation to that land in accordance with law and if any amount is realised against such land, the same shall be paid to the Petitioner in part satisfaction of the Recovery Certificate. 18.20. The application for interim reliefs is accordingly allowed in the aforesaid terms. Parties shall be at liberty to apply. Costs will be considered at the stage of final disposal of the Writ Petition. 19. After this judgment was reserved, it was brought to our notice that Respondent No.4’s Special Leave Petition against the Order and Judgment dated 9\" March, 2021, has been dismissed by the Supreme Court on 14\" July, 2021. This is noted for completeness."},

Writ Petition No.1127 of 2024 concerns Petitioner's property measuring 279 sq. mtrs surveyed under No.273, Hissa No.1 (Part), CTS No.738-B/1A Part of village Malada, Taluka Borivali, Mumbai Suburban District, Mumbai, locally known as Kokanipada, Kurar Village, Malad (East), Mumbai 400097 (Collectively referred as \"the said property\")    The Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1060 of 2024 challenges Order dated 13 April 2016 made under Section 3C(1) of the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvements, Clearance and Page 7 of 34  Redevelopment) Act, 1971 (\"the Slum Act\"); Order dated 30 August 2019 made under Section 14(1) of the Slum Act; Notification dated 30 June 2020 and Order dated 26 July 2022 made under Section 17 of the Slum Act, to the extent these orders affect the Petitioner's said property. Similarly, the Petitioner, in Writ Petition No.1127 of 2024, challenges the Notification dated 30 June 2020 published in the official gazette dated 09 July 2020 under Section 14 of the Slum Act to the extent it affects the Petitioner's said property.    Mr Pradeep Thorat, learned counsel for the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1060 of 2024, submitted that neither the Petitioner's name nor the description of the said property was included in the notices issued under Section 3C or Section 14 of the Slum Act. However, for the first time, the Petitioner's name and the Petitioner's said property were included in the notice dated  26 July 2022 issued under Section 17 of the Slum Act calling upon the Petitioner to accept compensation towards the acquisition of the Petitioner's said property.    Mr. Thorat submitted that the Petitioner's said property, up to this stage, was never a part of the acquisition proceedings undertaken by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (\"the SRA\") or the State Government. He submitted that without following the acquisition process or without including the Petitioner's name or the said property in the acquisition process, neither can any compensation be forced upon the Petitioner nor can the Petitioner's said property be treated as acquired under the provisions of Section 14 of the Slum Act. He, therefore, submitted Page 8 of 34  that the impugned orders and the notification made under Sections 14 and 17 of the Slum Act are arbitrary, ultra vires, null and void.    Mr Thorat submitted that such a completely flawed acquisition or attempted acquisition was, at the instance of the developer, developing a slum rehabilitation scheme. He submitted this acquisition had no real nexus with the construction of the slum redevelopment buildings but this so-called acquisition was only to widen the DP Road. However, instead of resorting to provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. (\"2013 Acquisition Act\") or applying the provisions of Development Control Regulations for the acquisition of the Petitioner's said property, an attempt was made to unlawfully acquire the Petitioner's said property by resorting to the provisions of the Slum Act. Mr. Thorat submitted that even this attempt was contrary to law inasmuch as there were no acquisition proceedings initiated against the Petitioner's said property, but the Petitioner's said property was sought to be included in the notice under Section 17 of the Slum Act for the first time when the previous notices under Section 3(C) or Section 14 of the Slum Act neither referred to the Petitioner nor the Petitioner's said property.    Mr. Thorat submitted that the BMC, in its Affidavit in Reply, has pleaded that the Petitioner's five structures had to be demolished to widen the DP Road. Therefore, by a subterfuge, the Petitioner's said property was sought to be included in the acquisition proceedings at the stage of issuance of notice under Section 17 of the Slum Act to determine the quantum of Page 9 of 34  compensation. He submitted that for all the crucial stages before this stage, admittedly, neither was the Petitioner's name nor the Petitioner's said property even referred to in the notices and the notification issued under the Slum Act. He, therefore, submitted that the action was affected by legal malafides and warrants interference with the impugned orders and notifications.    Mr Thorat submitted that the provisions for the acquisition of property have to be strictly construed. He submitted that notice to a land owner or a person interested is mandatory, and any attempted acquisition without such notice is unfair and violative of Article 300A of the Constitution of India. He submitted that under the scheme of the Slum Act, the first opportunity to undertake a slum redevelopment scheme has to be offered to the landlord. Only upon failure to do so can the State Government proceed to acquire the property on the recommendation of the SRA. He submitted that the procedure adopted by the Respondents in the present case blatantly violates the law in the      and    .    Mr. Yashodeep Deshmukh, learned counsel for the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1127 of 2024, adopted Mr. Thorat's submissions. He also submitted that the Petitioner's property was not even affected by the DP Road, and therefore, the attempted flawed acquisition was affected by legal malafides. 2 2   Bom 82 2 Page 10 of 34    Mr. Deshmukh submitted that until the last moment, neither the Petitioner's name nor the Petitioner's said property was included in any of the notices or notifications during the acquisition process. Only in the final notification, or rather the notice under Section 17 of the Slum Act, some paltry compensation was offered to the Petitioner, and an attempt was made to acquire the Petitioner's said property.    Mr Deshmukh submitted that this Court granted interim relief in both the Petitions and that the Respondents were restrained from taking possession of the said properties from the Petitioners. He submitted that neither the procedure prescribed under the Slum Act nor the rulings of this Court were followed in the attempt to acquire the Petitioner's said property. He, therefore, submitted that the impugned notices/notifications/orders should be set aside.    Mr Thorat and Mr Deshmukh submitted that the impugned notices/notifications/orders should be set aside for all the above reasons.    Dr Milind Sathe learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent - SRA in both these Petitions, submitted that the notices and the survey plans had included the Petitioners' properties in the notices and notification concerning the acquisition. He, however, submitted that the Petitioners' names could not be reflected in the initial notices and notification because the Petitioners' names were included in the property card on 01 December 2016 and 09 January Page 11 of 34  2017, respectively, which was much after the notices dated 12 February 2016 or 18 May 2016 were issued under the provisions of the Slum Act. He submitted that since the Petitioners had not bothered to get their names included in the property cards, neither the SRA nor the State Government could be faulted for not including the Petitioners names in the impugned notices or notification for acquisition of their properties under the Slum Act.    Dr Sathe submitted that after the Petitioners' names were entered into the property cards on 01 December 2016 and 09 January 2017, respectively, the authorities deemed it appropriate to pay/offer compensation to the Petitioners because it is the Petitioners' properties that were being acquired under the Slum Act. He submitted that the Petitioners, who failed to take any steps to get their names included in the property cards within a reasonable period, cannot now complain about their non-inclusion in the notices and notifications leading to the acquisition of their properties. Dr. Sathe submitted that there was no breach of the procedure under the Slum Act or of Article 300A of the Constitution of India because the authorities had fairly offered and were willing to pay compensation to both the Petitioners towards acquiring their properties.    Dr. Sathe relied on the judgment of this Court in      to submit that under almost similar circumstances, no relief was granted to the land owners who had failed to take steps to  Bom 6591 Page 12 of 34  get their names included in the property cards within a reasonable period.    Dr Sathe submitted that Section 3C of the Slum Act, as it stood before the 2018 Amendment, did not even contemplate the issue of any notice to the landowners. Such a requirement was introduced only after 2018. Therefore, the orders issued in 2016 under Section 3C of the Slum Act cannot be faulted for want of notices to the Petitioners. He relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court in    to support this contention. He also submitted that the decisions Mr Thorat relied upon were distinguishable on facts, and based on those facts, no relief was due to the Petitioners.    For all the above reasons, Dr. Sathe submitted that these Petitions may be dismissed and interim relief may be vacated.    Mr. Khandeparkar, learned counsel for the Respondent- Developer, submitted that the redevelopment project had advanced substantially. If the acquisition of 1050 sq. mtrs. is interfered with at this stage, the same will affect the further progress of the redevelopment scheme. He submitted that by setting aside the acquisition, it was not as if the Petitioners would get any additional compensation by insisting upon resorting to acquisition under the 2013 Acquisition Act or the DP Regulations. He submitted that the Slum Act was a self-contained code, and its provisions would 4 ( Page 13 of 34  always override the provisions of the 2013 Acquisition Act or the DP Regulations.    Mr. Khandeparkar submitted that these Petitions were barred by laches because at least the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1060 of 2024 was challenging the declaration under Section 3C of the Slum Act issued on 13 April 2014 by instituting this Petition on 04 November 2022. He submitted that there was no explanation for this inordinate delay, and therefore, this Petition should be dismissed on the grounds of unexplained and inordinate delay and laches.    Mr. Khandeparkar submitted that, in any event, the Petitioners had the remedy of Appeal under Section 3C(2) of the Slum Act to question an order under Section 3C(1) of the Slum Act. He submitted that even factually, the circumstances sufficient to declare the area a slum rehabilitation area clearly existed at the site. He pointed out that in 1986, this area was declared a slum area, and there was never any challenge to all this.    Mr. Khandeparkar submitted that there was no infirmity in the acquisition. Assuming there were any slight irregularities involved, the writ jurisdiction ought not to be exercised considering that the redevelopment scheme had advanced substantially and Petitioners' gains were not comparable to the prejudice the developer and, consequently, the slum dwellers would face, in case the orders under Section 3C or the acquisition was set aside. Page 14 of 34     Amogh Singh, learned counsel Respondent— Society of Slum Dwellers—adopted Dr Sathe's and Mr Khandeparkar's arguments. He submitted that the slum dwellers would be prejudiced if the acquisition was interfered with at this stage.    In rejoinder, Mr. Thorat and Mr. Deshmukh submitted why the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the Respondents were distinguishable. Mr Thorat relied on      . to submit that since the Petitioners had purchased the properties by registered documents, the law cast no further obligation on them to correct the property cards.    Mr Thorat submitted that the notices and the notification referred to 4 property holders owning distinct plots from the total property measuring over 46000 sq. mtrs. He submitted that under such circumstances, the Petitioners had no reason to suspect that their properties were included within the area of 1050 sq. mtrs, even though the names of 4 other persons were set out in the notices and the notification.    Mr Thorat submitted that ultimately, the properties of the persons whose names were included in the impugned notices/notification were not acquired, and only the Petitioners' said properties are sought to be acquired by forcing some compensation on them, even though they were neither notified nor granted any opportunity as contemplated by law before any 5  Page 15 of 34  purported acquisition. He submitted that until the issuance of impugned notice under Section 17 of the Slum Act determining and offering compensation, even the Respondents had not contemplated the acquisition of the Petitioners' properties. Only because the BMC pointed out that the Petitioner's five structures would require demolition for the widening of DP Road that at the last movement, the notices were issued to the Petitioners offering compensation even without acquiring the Petitioners' properties following the law.    Mr Thorat and Mr Deshmukh submitted that this acquisition had nothing to do with the slum redevelopment scheme and that this was an attempt to deny the petitioners compensation under the 2013 Act or DP regulations. They submitted that the project would not be delayed if this acquisition was struck down. On the above grounds, they submitted that the Rule is liable to be made absolute in both these Petitions.    The rival contentions now fall for our determination.    The property bearing CTS No.738 is a large property measuring 46868.50 sq. mtrs. (\"the larger property\"). The impugned and alleged acquisition concerns only 1050 sq. mtrs. from this larger property. This being so, the SRA had to identify the acquired portion with some reasonable precision so that the persons interested would have a fair idea that it was their portion that was contemplated to be acquired. In these matters, the records show that there was no reference to the petitioners or their properties in the impugned notices and orders by which their Page 16 of 34  properties are supposed to have been acquired. Only at the final stage were the petitioners issued notices offering them compensation and threatening to take over their properties. By interim orders made on 24 January 2023 and 1 February 2023 inter alia restraining the petitioners' dispossession.    At one point, this larger property, measuring 46868.50 sq. mtrs, was entirely owned by F. E. Dinshaw and Nusli Wadia. However, portions of this property were transferred and re- transferred from time to time. This is evident from the various entries in the property cards placed by the Petitioners on record (See Exhibit-A on pages 51 to 54 in Writ Petition No.1060 of 2024).    The record in Writ Petition No.1060 of 2024 shows that the Petitioner's father, Swaminath Singh, purchased a portion of the larger property admeasuring 440 sq. mtrs along with the structures therein from Noormohammed Shaikh vide a registered sale deed dated 15 January 1974. Similarly, in Writ Petition No.1127 of 2024, the Petitioner purchased a portion of the larger property measuring 279 sq. mtrs from Noormohammed Shaikh vide a registered sale deed dated 04 May 1974. Thus, there is no dispute about the Petitioners owning the distinct portions of 440 sq. mtrs and 279 sq. mtrs. from out of the larger property measuring 46868.50 sq. mtrs. based on registered conveyances.    On 12 February 2016, the SRA issued a public notice declaring the properties described in the notice as slum rehabilitation areas under Section 3C of the Slum Act. This public notice is on page 394 of the paper book in Writ Petition No.1060 of Page 17 of 34  2024. The SRA's public notice dated 12 February 2016 states that the application was received from the Chairman of Kokani Pada Co-op Housing Society (Proposed) requesting to declare the area of land bearing C.T.S. No.738/B/1A (Pt.) of Village - Malad, Taluka-Borivali for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme of the said Society as \"Slum Rehabilitation Area\" under Section 3C (1) of the Slum Act.    The public notice also states that \"        The particulars of area proposed to be declared as Slum Rehabilitation Area.              (  1. Village- 46868.5 950.50 C.T.S. C.T.S. C.T.S. C.T.S. Page 18 of 34      The public notice dated 12 February 2016 informs the land owners or any others who claim to have any right, title, and interest (if any) that they could object to the declaration of the property measuring 950.50 sq. mtrs as a slum rehabilitation area within ten days from the publication of this notice.    The public notice dated 12 February 2016 nowhere refers to the properties held by the two Petitioners. Instead, it refers to the properties held by Miss Bachubai Voronzov Dashukov, Mr. Nasali Nevil Vadiya, and the Administrator of Hadalji Dinshaw. The public notice also refers to the properties distinctly held by Ms Chandrakala Dayashankar Singh, Sapna Trading Corporation, and M/s. New Ajmera Construction and Developers. From the recitals in the public notice, it appears that the SRA has gone by the information furnished by the \"applicant\", i.e. Chairman of Kokani Pada Co-op Housing Society (Proposed), without any independent application of mind.    The property card on pages 51 to 54 of the paper book in Writ Petition No.1060 of 2024 is extremely relevant and was relied on by the learned counsel for the Petitioners and the Respondents exhaustively. This property card refers to the property/portion measuring 460 sq. mtrs held by Smt. Chandrakala Dayashankar Singh, the property/portion measuring 1225 sq. mtrs. held by Page 19 of 34  Sapna Trading Corporation and the property/portion measuring 3387.5 sq. mtrs. held by New Ajmera Construction and Developers.    Given the above position, the contention that as of 12 February 2016, only the four names referred to in the notice dated  12 February 2016 were reflected in the property card is incorrect. Several names are included in the property card, indicating the extent of holdings of such holders. Still, the public notice dated 12 February 2016 refers only to the above names of holders having distinct portions of the larger property. From the notice, there was no reason for the two Petitioners even to suspect that the portions of the larger property held by them or acquired by them through the registered conveyances were sought to be included in the acquisition process. Very clearly, therefore, the public notice dated  12 February 2016 did not refer to the Petitioners or the Petitioners' said properties. Instead, the public notice referred to the properties/portions held by the persons named in the said public notice and not the others like the petitioners.    Dr. Sathe tried to contend that such public notices are usually based on survey or acquisition plans. He referred to one plan to contend that the public notice should be read along with such a plan, and when so read, the Petitioners' said properties could also be seen as included. This is, with respect, a tenuous contention backed by no credible material on record. Neither any pleadings nor any documents back such a contention.    The public notice dated 12 February 2016 refers to no survey or acquisition plans. The pleadings on behalf of the SRA also refer Page 20 of 34  to no such plans in clear terms. Even the plan shown to us does not clearly refer to the Petitioners' said properties. Therefore, the SRA's insistence that the public notice dated 12 February 2016 included the Petitioners' said properties but not the Petitioners' names because the Petitioners' names were not entered on the property cards by 12 February 2016 is a defence that cannot be so easily accepted in the facts of the present case. Rather, the SRA appears to be taking advantage of the fact that the Petitioners' names were entered into the property cards on 01 December 2016 and 09 January 2017, respectively, i.e. within a few days of the SRA's public notice dated 12 February 2016 even though the major portion of the acquisition process was after the inclusion of petitioners' names.    The SRA published yet another public notice on 18 May 2016 to enhance the area of 950 sq. mtrs, which was earlier sought to be declared as a slum rehabilitation area, to 1050 sq. mtrs. The contents of the notices dated 12 February 2016 and 18 May 2016 are substantially the same, except that the notice dated 18 May 2016 refers to the area of 1050 sq. mtrs. In the column concerning the names of the owners/Imala Malak, the same names as appeared in the public notice dated 12 February 2016 have been shown. Again, from the notice dated 18 May 2016, it is impossible to conclude that the Petitioners' said properties were included or even intended to be included for acquisition under Section 14 of the Slum Act. The petitioners' names are admittedly not included even in this notice. Page 21 of 34    The Petitioners have placed on record a report made by the Chief Executive Officer, SRA, on 30 August 2019 dealing with objections raised by some of the parties shown in the public notices dated 12 February 2016 and 18 May 2016. The report shows that one of the objectors withdrew the objection, and the other objector, i.e. New Ajmera Constructions and Developers, pressed the objection. However, such objections were rejected by the vague reasoning that the property held by New Ajmera Constructions and Developers was not the subject matter of acquisition. Even this report does not say that it was the petitioners' said properties that were the subject matter of acquisition. By this time, admittedly, the petitioners' names were very much recorded on the property card. The excuse about the late recording of the petitioners' names in the property card was clearly unavailable when this report was made on  30 August 2019.    By the time the Chief Executive Officer of SRA made his report dated 30 August 2019, the Petitioners' names had been included in the property cards. The Petitioners' names were, in fact, included in the property cards on 01 December 2016 and 09 January 2017. After observing that the property held by New Ajmera Constructions and Developers was not being acquired, the Chief Executive Officer, SRA, did not take cognisance of the Petitioners' names in the property cards and did not bother to issue any notices to the Petitioners, if the Petitioners' said properties were really included or intended to be included in the property described in the public notices dated 12 February 2016 and 18 May 2016. This would have been the most natural and reasonable manner of proceeding with the acquisition. Page 22 of 34    Based on the Chief Executive Officer, SRA's report dated 30 August 2019, the State Government made the order dated 30 June 2020 published in the official gazette dated 09 July 2020 under Section 14 of the Slum Act for acquiring the property which was the subject matter of the notices dated 12 February 2016 and 18 May 2016. Even this notification, dated 30 June 2020, refers to the same names as appeared in the two notices dated 12 February 2016 and 18 May 2016. This was after the CEO, SRA's report dated 30 August 2019, had recorded the properties of Chandrakala Dayashankar Singh, Sapna Trading Corporation or M/s. New Ajmera Construction and Developers were not included in the acquisition. This was also admittedly after the petitioners' names were included in the property cards, and this excuse was no longer available to the authorities.    Again, if the two notices had indeed referred to the Petitioners' said properties, then most reasonably and naturally, one would have expected this position to be cleared in the Chief Executive Officer, SRA's report dated 30 August 2019, by which time the names of both the Petitioners had been entered into the property cards. Similarly, the Chief Executive Officer of SRA would have recommended to the State Government to include the Petitioners' names in the final acquisition notification dated 30 June 2020 so that there would be no confusion or lack of clarity about which land or whose land was being acquired. Surprisingly, even the government's acquisition order dated 30 June 2020 does not refer to the Petitioners' names and, consequently, the Petitioners' said properties as the subject matter of the acquisition. Page 23 of 34    After almost two years, the Chief Executive Officer, SRA, again, without even bothering to hear any of the Petitioners by presuming that the Petitioners' said properties were included in the notices dated 12 February 2016 and 18 May 2016, order dated 30 August 2019 and the Government's Notification dated 30 June 2020 (even though none of these documents referred to either the Petitioners or their said properties) has proceeded to determine the compensation of Rs.14,26,794/- as payable to the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1060 of 2024 and compensation of Rs.9,04,717/- as payable to the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1127 of 2024. Based on this notice dated 26 July 2022, the Respondents contend that the Petitioners' properties were acquired in pursuance of the notices dated 12 February 2016, 18 May 2016, and the orders dated  30 August 2019 and 30 June 2020, even though none of these documents refer to the Petitioner or Petitioners' properties.    The Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1127 of 2024 rushed to the Civil Court when based upon the Chief Executive Officer, SRA's order dated 26 July 2022, he apprehended immediate dispossession. Mr. Deshmukh, the learned counsel for the Petitioner, submitted that this fact was pleaded in the Writ petition. He explained that at that stage, the Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1127 of 2024 had no inkling about the notices dated 12 February 2016, 18 May 2016 or the orders dated 30 August 2019 and 30 June 2020, which did not even refer to the Petitioner' names or their said properties. After the Petitioners were apprised of these documents, the present Petition was instituted after making full disclosure. Page 24 of 34    The Petitioner in Writ Petition No.1127 of 2024 cannot be faulted for rushing to the Civil Court based on the limited information available to the Petitioner. This Petitioner has not suppressed any facts but made full disclosure in the present Petition. Therefore, the half-hearted contention that Writ petition No.1127 of 2024 should not be entertained because of the suit instituted by the Petitioner therein cannot be accepted in the facts or present case.    Similarly, the developer's contention about delay or laches is also misconceived. Only after the petitioners received the notice dated 26 July 2022 could they be attributed with some knowledge that their properties were sought to be acquired. The Petitioners instituted their petitions on 28 September 2022 and 16 November 2022. As observed earlier, the notices neither referred to the petitioners nor their properties. Therefore, there was no question of delay or laches involved. Besides, this Court granted interim relief on 24 January 2023 and 1 February 2023 inter alia, restraining the authorities from taking over the possession of the petitioners' properties. So, it was not as if the authorities undertook any works pursuant to the impugned orders or changed their position substantially or otherwise. There is no material to suggest that the slum redevelopment scheme is suffering due to the interim order made by this Court. The Petitioners have contended that this exercise was nothing but an attempt to acquire Petitioners' properties to widen the DP road. This attempted acquisition was only to avoid payment of compensation under the 2013 Act or the Page 25 of 34  DP regulations. Therefore, the objection based on any alleged delay or laches cannot be sustained.    Dr Sathe explained that at the stage of determining the compensation, it was realised that the Petitioners were the owners of the properties, which were the subject matter of the acquisition under notices dated 12 February 2016 and 18 May 2016. Therefore, the compensation was determined and awarded favouring the two Petitioners. He submitted that by 26 July 2022, the Petitioners' names were already included in the property cards. As noted earlier, the Petitioners' names were included in the property cards on 01 December 2016 and 09 January 2017. After this, the Chief Executive Officer of SRA made his report dated 30 August 2019 without taking any cognisance of the Petitioners' names on the property cards. Similarly, based upon the Chief Executive Officer, SRA's report dated 30 August 2019, the State Government made its order dated 30 June 2020, again, without taking any cognisance of the Petitioners' names in the property cards. Surprisingly, the Chief Executive Officer, SRA, takes cognisance of the Petitioners' names in the property cards only on 26 July 2022 and determines compensation.    Mr Thorat and Mr Deshmukh are justified in submitting that this last-minute switch was because the BMC informed the SRA that demolishing the Petitioner's structures might be necessary for widening the DP Road. Therefore, the entire procedure, which had neither involved the Petitioners nor the Petitioners' said properties, was sought to be downplayed. The order dated 26 July 2022 purports to create an impression that the Petitioners' said Page 26 of 34  properties were the subject matter of the acquisition proceedings. However, neither the Petitioners' names nor their properties were referred to in the notices dated 12 February 2016 and 18 May 2016 or the Chief Executive Officer, SRA's report dated 30 August 2019, and the State Government's order dated 30 June 2020.    The BMC has filed an Affidavit in this matter on 03 March 2023. Paragraph 7 of this Affidavit reads as follows:-                            There was no coordination between the BMC and the SRA. Therefore, the properties held by the persons whose names were reflected in almost all the acquisition documents except the final document dated 26 July 2022 were proposed to be acquired. Possibly, at the last stage, a crude attempt was made to include the Petitioners' said properties by determining the compensation payable to the two Petitioners. The Respondents have adopted a procedure not known to law. By adopting this procedure, the Respondents, particularly the SRA and the State Government, Page 27 of 34  have breached the principles of natural justice and fair play. They have also breached the statutory requirement of issuing notices to the landowners before acquiring their properties.    Several decisions have underscored the importance of granting a land owner an opportunity to show cause why his or her land should not be acquired. These are some of the few safeguards a land owner has been provided under the various compulsory acquisition legislations. The property right may no longer be a fundamental right, but it is still accepted as a constitutional or human right. Such right cannot be taken away by deviating from the prescribed procedure or adopting an arbitrary procedure that almost borders on subterfuge.    In   the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that property rights are human rights and constitutional rights, and they cannot be taken away except in accordance with the law. Article 300-A of the Constitution protects such a right. The provisions of the Act seeking to divest such a right, keeping in view the provisions of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India, must be strictly construed.    The explanation about the Petitioners' names being included in the property cards only on 01 December 2016 or 09 January 2017 would be understandable, provided the notices had referred to the names of the predecessor-in-title of the Petitioners. Most of the procedures undertaken by the Chief Executive Officer, SRA or the State Government were after 01 December   SC 953 : ( Page 28 of 34  2017, when the Petitioners' names were already included in the property cards. Still, the Petitioners and even their properties were excluded from the acquisition procedure. Only when it came to determining the compensation did the Chief Executive Officer of SRA suddenly take cognisance of the property cards' entries and declare that the Petitioners' said properties stand acquired and offered to pay compensation for such alleged acquisition. Such a procedure is contrary to the provisions of the Slum Act. Such a procedure is contrary to the basic principles of natural justice and fair play, which ought to inhere such a compulsory acquisition process.    The decision of the Coordinate Bench in   (supra) is distinguishable because the fact situation in the said decision is not comparable to the situation in the present case. Firstly, unlike in the present case, it was only after the final notification under Section 14 of the Slum Act issued on 01 September 2010 that the Petitioners in   (supra) got their names included in the property card in December 2011. In the present case, the Petitioners' names were included in the property card on 01 December 2016 and 09 January 2017, respectively. The impugned order under Section 14(1) of the Slum Act was issued on 30 August 2019. The final notification was on 30 June 2020, i.e. almost three years after the Petitioners' names were entered in the property cards.    Secondly, unlike in the present case, the predecessor-in-title of the Petitioners in   (supra) was issued notices and heard before the issuance of the impugned notification dated 01 Page 29 of 34  September 2010. There was no dispute that the Petitioners were claiming title through M/s. Fazalbhoy Construction Co. and M/s. Morinaga Traders. Both these parties were duly noticed and heard before the impugned notification dated 01 September 2010 was issued. All this is evident from a letter dated 20 June 2007 addressed by M/s. J. S. Anand and Associates on behalf of the predecessor-in-title of the Petitioners referred to in paragraph 17 of the judgment.    Similarly, the discussion in paragraph 18 shows that the predecessor-in-title of the Petitioners filed their response to the notices issued to them, filed written arguments opposing acquisition proceedings and were heard before the impugned notification dated 01 September 2010 was issued. In these circumstances, the Coordinate Bench held that the Petitioners, who had not bothered to correct the property records at any stage before the notification dated 01 September 2010 was issued, could have no grievance against the acquisition proceedings on the ground of want of notice. Admittedly, the Petitioners do not claim through Miss Chandrakala Dayashankar Singh, Sapna Trading Corporation, and M/s New Ajmera Construction And Developers. In the present case, the predecessor-in-title of the petitioners were never noticed or heard in these acquisition proceedings. Therefore, the decision in   (supra) is clearly distinguishable on facts.    (supra) holds that prior notice under Section 3-C was not required before declaring any area as a slum rehabilitation area in terms of the law as it stood before 26 April Page 30 of 34  2018. However, the order declaring a slum rehabilitation area, i.e. the slum rehabilitation order, had to be given \"    In this case, the order under Section 3(C)(1) was made on 13 April 2016. This order did not refer to the Petitioners' names or the Petitioners' said properties. In any event, in these Petitions, we do not propose to entertain the Petitioners challenge to the slum rehabilitation order dated 13 April 2016 made under Section 3(C)  (1) of the Slum Act because Section 3(C)(2) of the Slum Act had provided that any person aggrieved by the slum rehabilitation order may, within four weeks from the publication of such order, prefer an appeal to the Special Tribunal and the decision of the Special Tribunal shall be final. Therefore, we decline to set aside the slum rehabilitation order dated 13 April 2016 in these Petitions, leaving it open to the Petitioners to explore the possibility of challenging it.    However, our non-interference with the slum rehabilitation order dated 13 April 2016 on the above ground is no bar to interfering with the notification dated 30 June 2020 purporting to acquire the Petitioners' said properties under Section 14 of the Slum Act. Even after issuing the valid order under Section 3(C)(1) of the Slum Act, legal and proper proceedings must be taken to acquire the property, which is the subject matter of a slum rehabilitation order. This procedure clearly contemplates notice to the owners, particularly because the owners are to be granted the opportunity to develop such property in the first instance.    Apart from the question of notice, the authorities must properly identify and describe the property sought to be acquired Page 31 of 34  under Section 14 of the Slum Act. In the present case, a perusal of the notices dated 12 February 2016, 13 April 2016, and 18 May 2016, the CEO, SRA's order dated 30 August 2019, and the notification dated 30 June 2020 neither refer to the Petitioners' names nor the Petitioners' said properties. Only the notice dated  26 July 2022 determining the compensation refers to the Petitioners' names. This is despite the Petitioners' names being included in the property cards on 01 December 2016 and 09 January 2017, respectively. Based upon such serious omissions, there is no question of acquiring the Petitioner's said properties or proceeding on the premise that the Petitioner's said properties had been acquired under the notification dated 30 June 2020.    Admittedly, in this case, the Petitioners purchased the said properties under the registered conveyances. In     (supra) the Coordinate Bench held that when a transfer of immovable property is effected by way of a registered instrument, a subsequent purchaser is said to have implied notice of the same. Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act of 1882 considers not only the actual notice but also implied notice by way of a registered instrument, provided that the instrument is required by law to be registered. Therefore, mere non-entering of the encumbrances in the revenue records cannot be an excuse. Moreover, the second proviso to Section 149 of the MLRC exempts the obligation of reporting the acquisition of rights by a registered instrument to the revenue authorities.    But even if the principle in the above ruling is not applied, still, for the several reasons discussed above, the excuse about the Page 32 of 34  absence of petitioners' names in the property card when the initial or preliminary acquisition notices were issued cannot be accepted. This is a case where most of the crucial processes were after the inclusion. Even the preliminary notices did not refer to petitioners' properties but some other properties. The names of other property owners (but not the petitioners' names) were included in such preliminary and final notices. The petitioners' names were only included for the very first time in the notice determining compensation.    This is not how the authorities can attempt to acquire its citizens' properties compulsorily. The compulsory acquisition of properties, even under the Slum Act, is a serious matter, particularly since property owners are made to part with their properties for compensation, which is much less than the compensation offered under the 2013 Act or DP Regulations. Besides, in such a case, the property owners are to be divested of their property to facilitate a slum redevelopment allegedly. Therefore, compulsory acquisition, in such cases, cannot be lightly resorted to, and certainly not by disregarding the safeguards that the law prescribes.    In     the Coordinate Bench of this Court has held that when valuable private rights as guaranteed under Article 300A of the Constitution to an owner of the land are being deprived under the garb of slum rehabilitation, there has to be an insurmountable situation on record of the SRA  Bom 1632 Page 33 of 34  or for any reasonable body of persons to come to an unimpeachable conclusion that the only and only remedy and/or avenue in a given case is to acquire the private land and not to permit the owner of the land to undertake the development. The CEO of SRA has an onerous obligation to reasonably, non-arbitrarily, and objectively deal with the valuable property rights of private citizens who are dragged into such a situation that the monsters of encroachment and persons supporting them take the rule of law in their hands in depriving the land owner of his property right. They forget that there is a rule of law and there are courts and any such attempt to dent the rule of law can be dealt with iron hands.    For all the above reasons, we quash and set aside the orders dated 30 August 2019, the notification dated 30 June 2020 made under Section 14 of the Slum Act and the order dated 26 July 2022 made under Section 17 of the Slum Act to the extent these orders affect the Petitioners and the Petitioners' said properties (as described in paragraph 4 of this Judgment and Order).    The rule is made absolute in the above terms, and the interim orders are hereby confirmed. There shall be no orders for costs.    In view of disposal of Writ Petitions, Interim Application No.984 of 2023 does not survive and the same is accordingly disposed of.   Page 34 of 34"},

Law Square         __________          1. By this Appeal, Appellant challenges judgment and order dated  9 October 2019 passed by the Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai ( ) rejecting the Appeal to the extent of the project ' ' and granting liberty to the Appellant to take further appropriate steps in respect of ' . Appeal was katkam  3  preferred by Appellant before Appellate Authority challenging order dated 5 September 2018 passed by the Regulatory Authority dismissing his complaint filed seeking direction against Respondents for initiation of action for non- registration of both the projects.  2. Facts of the case are as follows. Respondent No.1-Emnoy Properties India, a Limited Liability Partnership, with Respondent Nos.2 and 3 as its partners, were implementing project for sale of various bungalow plots under name ' ' at village Nandgaon, Taluka Mawal, Tungarli, Lonavala. Appellant and his mother were desirous of purchasing a plot in Valvan Valley project and accordingly agreed to purchase Plot No.13-B (Part A) admeasuring 22,000 square feet for consideration of Rs. 55,00,000/-. They paid an amount of Rs.12,50,000/- towards part consideration and Respondent No.1 issued allotment letter and receipt dated 28 August 2012 in the joint names of Appellant and his mother. As per the allotment letter, permission for Non Agricultural ( ) use of the land was to be obtained by April 2013 and possession of the plot was to be handed over against payment of balance consideration by August 2013. It appears that NA permission was not secured within the agreed time up to August 2013. An agreement for sale was executed between Respondent No.1 as Vendor and Appellant and his mother as Purchaser, under which, the project completion period was agreed as two years. It is the case of Appellant that Respondent No.1 failed to complete the project and later informed the Appellant that Valvan Valley project was taken over by Valvan Valley Infrastructure Private Limited, an incorporated katkam  4  company with Respondent Nos.5 and 6 as its Directors. According to Appellant, Respondent Nos.1 to 6 failed to honour their commitments and therefore Respondent Nos. 2, 5 and 6 offered to convey and sale four small plots in Lion's Valley project i.e. NA Plot   square meters), 34 (464 square meters), 35 (464 square meters) and 36 (464 square meters) in lieu of Plot No.13-B in Valvan Valley project on payment of balance amount of consideration of Rs.42,50,000/-. However, since the said four plots were not conveyed to Appellant, he filed Complaint before State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission against Respondent Nos. 1 to 7 seeking sale and conveyance of the four plots in Lion's Valley project or for monetary compensation in the alternative. On 9 May 2017 State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission passed interim order restraining Respondent Nos. 1 to 7 from transferring or selling the four plots in Lion's Valley project.  3. After coming into effect of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 ( ) on 6 November 2017, according to Appellant, it became duty of Respondents to register both the projects within 90 days. However, none of the two projects were registered. Instead Respondent Nos. 7 and 8 continued promoting and marketing Lion's Valley project by issuance of broachers. In the Lion's Valley project, according to Appellant, there are 19 independent luxury bungalows spread across area of 2 acres. According to Appellant, Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority ( ) failed to take action against Respondent Nos.1 to 10 for non-registration of either of the projects. Appellant therefore filed Writ Petition (L) No.908 of katkam  5  2018 before this court seeking directions for formulation of mechanism to deal with complaints against unregistered projects. On 31 July 2018, MahaRERA gave undertaking before this court that it would modify its software for entertaining complaints in relation to unregistered projects and that it would deal with such complaints. According to Appellant, though MahaRERA updated its software and provided online platform for filing complaints against unregistered projects, only few particulars could be uploaded on such online platform, which did not enable Appellant either to raise prayers or to submit documents in support of the complaint. Accordingly, Appellant lodged online complaint before MahaRERA on 20 August 2018 in respect of both Valvan Valley and Lion's Valley projects.  4. According to Appellant, when the complaint came up before MahaRERA on 5 September 2018, the same came to be dismissed without grant of opportunity to Appellant to produce supporting documents. The complaint was rejected by holding that the land, in which plot was agreed to be purchased by Appellant, is agricultural land and that no permission was granted by any Competent Authority for development of the said land. MahaRERA therefore held that the same cannot be treated as a project within the meaning of Section 2(zn) of the RERA.  5. Aggrieved by order dated 5 September 2018, Appellant filed Appeal before the Appellate Tribunal under section 44 of the RERA which was not accepted on online portal on account of non-availability of facility of filing Appeal in respect of unregistered project. Appellant filed Writ Petition (L) katkam  6  No. 3991 of 2018 challenging the order dated 5 September 2018 passed by MahaRERA. When Petition came up before Division Bench of this Court, it was submitted on behalf of MahaRERA that Appeal could be filed before the Appellate Tribunal in respect of unregistered project. Accordingly, Appellant was permitted to file Appeal before the Appellate Tribunal without prejudice to filing of the Petition. Accordingly, Appellant filed Appeal before the Appellate Tribunal on 18 December 2018. On 20 December 2018, the Appellate Tribunal granted interim order restraining the Respondents from marketing, promoting or selling any plot in the projects Valvan Valley and Lion's Valley. Respondent Nos.1 to 7 filed their Reply in the Appeal raising a contention that the agreement for sale was cancelled by the Appellant and amount of Rs.9,00,000/- was refunded to Mr. Sikander Ali Khan and Mr. Sishan Khan at Appellant's instance. Respondent Nos.8 to 10 filed separate Reply opposing the Appeal. According to Appellant, the plots in Lion's Valley project were marketed and sold by Respondent No.8 in violation of interim order passed by the Appellate Tribunal.  6. By judgment and order dated 9 October 2019, the Appellate Tribunal dismissed Appellant's Appeal thereby refusing to give any direction for registration of project Valvan Valley or granting prayer of the Appellant for compensation or imposition of penalty and upholding the order passed by MahaRERA. So far as Lion's Valley project is concerned, the Appellate Tribunal has given liberty to MahaRERA as well as to Appellant to take further appropriate steps. Aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 9 katkam  7  October 2019 passed by the Appellant Tribunal, Appellant has filed present Second Appeal.  7. When the Appeal came up for admission on 4 December 2020, this court admitted the Appeal on formulating following substantial question of law:  \"Whether the Real Estate Authority and RERA Appellate Tribunal were justified in refusing to entertain the complaint of the Appellant lodged against the Respondent-Promoter for contravention of the provisions of Section 3 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 for punishment under Section 59 of that Act, on the ground that the project was not registered as a Real Estate project under Section 3 of that Act, particularly having regard to Section 31 of that Act?\"  8. Mr. Gala, the learned counsel appearing for Appellant would submit that the Appellate Tribunal has erred in dismissing the Appeal filed by the Appellant and in upholding the order passed by MahaRERA. That both MahaRERA as well as Appellate Tribunal have erred in holding that complaints under section 31 of the RERA can be entertained only in respect of projects for which development permissions are issued by the Competent Authority. He would invite my attention to section 31 of the RERA in support of his contention that 'any aggrieved person' is entitled to file a complaint with the Authority for violation or contravention of provisions of the RERA or the Rules and Regulations made thereunder against any promoter, allottees or real estate agent. That MahaRERA was erroneously not permitting filing of complaints on its online platform against unregistered projects on account of katkam  8  which Appellant was required to knock the doors of this Court by filing Writ Petition No.908 of 2018. That though a solemn assurance was given to this Court on 31 July 2018 that software would be modified for entertaining 'complaints' in relation to unregistered projects, what was permitted by MahaRERA was only 'source info' for taking action against unregistered projects. That complaint for seeking return of amount and compensation, imposition of penalty, interest etc. under sections 12, 18 and 59 of the RERA can be filed in Form-A of Maharashtra Real Estate (Regulation and Development) (Recovery of Interest, Penalty, Compensation, Fine Payable, Forms of Complaints and Appeal, etc.) Rules, 2017 (   ). That no facility was made available for lodging of complaint in Form 'A' to the Appellant despite giving of assurance before this court by MahaRERA on 31 July 2018. That an allottee in respect of unregistered project is also entitled to seek compensation under section 12, return of amount and compensation under section 18 and imposition of penalty under section 59 of the RERA. That in order to enable such allottee of unregistered project to seek reliefs under sections 12, 18 and 59 of the RERA, MahaRERA ought to have created a facility for filing of complaint under Form 'A' of the MahaRERA Rules, 2017.  9. Mr. Gala would submit that the broad objective behind enacting the RERA and is to protect the interest of allottees and that if restrictive meaning is imparted to the provision of the RERA by not taking cognizance of complaints filed in respect of unregistered projects, the same would defeat the very objective behind enacting the RERA. In support of this contention, Mr. katkam  9  Gala would rely upon the judgment of the Apex Court in     (1989) 3 SCC 709. Relying on Division Bench judgment of this Court in       Bom 9302, Mr. Gala would submit that since provisions of the RERA are held to be retroactive in operation, non-registration of the project cannot be a reason to close doors on an allottee for redressal of his grievances in respect of project carried out in violation of provisions of the RERA.  10. Mr. Gala would submit that both MahaRERA as well as Appellate Tribunal have only considered the aspect as to whether projects Valvan Valley and Lion's Valley could be registered or not. That both the Regulatory Authority and Appellate Tribunal have failed to appreciate that an allottee in respect of unregistered project can also seek action against the promoter under provisions of sections 12, 18 and 59 of the RERA by filing a complaint under provisions of sections 31 and 71 thereof. That correct reading of provisions of sections 12 and 18 of the RERA would indicate that registration of a project is not mandatory. That proviso to Section 12 of the RERA uses the word 'proposed project' which clearly implies that even unregistered project would carry obligations for promoter thereof under section 12 of the RERA. Mr. Gala would therefore submit that Appellant be granted reliefs under sections 12, 18 and 59 of the RERA. Alternatively, he would submit that MahaRERA be directed to entertain Appellant's complaint under sections 12, 18, 59 read with sections 31 and 71 of the RERA for imposition of katkam  10  penalty for non-registration, for return of amount with interest together with compensation.  11.  , Mr. Mahadik the learned counsel appearing for Respondent Nos.3 to 6 would oppose the Appeal and would submit that the very grievance of the Appellant about non-entertainment or non-decision of his complaint is baseless. He would submit that both the MahaRERA as well as Appellate Tribunal have entertained the complaint filed by Appellant on merits and have recorded concurrent findings that in absence of issuance of any development permissions, the project cannot be registered and have rightly dismissed the complaint filed by Appellant. He would rely upon provisions of section 4 of the RERA in support of his contention that in absence of issuance of sanctioned plan, layout plan, commencement certificate etc., no real estate project can be registered. That the Appellate Tribunal has rightly held that provisions of RERA can apply only in respect of projects, which are liable or capable of registration. That admittedly the land in respect of which Appellant claims rights is in agricultural land, in respect of which no Planning or Competent Authority has sanctioned any plans/layout. That therefore the alleged project is not governed by provisions of the RERA. That therefore promoters of Valvan Valley project cannot be made liable under any of the provisions of the RERA. That therefore complaint filed by Appellant seeking registration of the project Valvan Valley has rightly been rejected by the MahaRERA and the Appellate Tribunal has rightly upheld MahaRERA's order. Mr.Mahadik would pray for dismissal of the Appeal. katkam  11  12. Mr. Parker, the learned counsel appearing for Respondent Nos.8 to 10 would submit that Appellant has no semblance of relation with Lion's Valley project. That Respondent Nos.8 to 10 had no notice of proceedings filed before MahaRERA and came to know about the same only at the stage of filing of Appeal before the Appellate Tribunal. That Respondent Nos.8 to 10 have absolutely no nexus with Respondent Nos.1 to 7. That Respondent Nos.8 to 10 are concerned with development of only Plot No.24 admeasuring 353 square meters that to under development agreement with owner of the said plot Mr. Rafiq Ramzanali Somani, who purchased the same from Respondent No.4 by registered conveyance deed on 28 July 2017. That plot being less than 500 square meters, is not liable for registration under the RERA. That Respondent Nos.8 to 10 are not concerned with Lion's Valley project nor have authorized agent or web portal to market the same. He would pray for dismissal of the Appeal.  13. Rival contentions raised on behalf of the parties now fall for my consideration.  14. Appellant claims that even though the projects Valvan Valley and Lion's Valley are not registered under provisions of the RERA, he is entitled to seek action against them for imposition of penalty, return of amount with interest as well as compensation under provisions of sections 12, 18 and 59 of the RERA by filing a complaint under section 31 of the RERA before MaharRERA. In the present case initially, Appellant was not even permitted to lodge any complaint before MahaRERA on the ground that the project was katkam  12  unregistered. It is only when Appellant filed Writ Petition No.908 of 2018 that MahaRERA realised that for enforcing compliance with section 3 of the RERA for registration of projects, it was necessary to create a facility on its online portal for receiving 'source information' so that necessary action can be initiated against persons/entities undertaking real estate project in absence of registration. In Writ Petition (L) No.908 of 2018, MahaRERA filed Affidavit dated 5 July 2018 contending in paragraphs 4 and 5 as under:  \"4. In this regard, I hereby bring to the kind notice of this Honourable Court the following points;  (a) In accordance with the provisions of Section 3 r/w Rule 3 of the said Act as well as Maharashtra Real Estate (Regulation and Development) (Registration of Real Estate Projects, Registration of Real Estate Agents, Rates of Interest and Disclosures on Website) Rules, 2017 no promoter shall advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale invite person to purchase in any manner any plot apartment, etc. in a planning area without registering the real estate project. Thus, prior registration of Real Estate Projects with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority is mandatory.  (b) Section 4 provides the mandatory requirements for the purpose of Registration of the Project. Some of the mandatory provisions are as under-  (i) An authenticated copy of the approvals and commencement certificate from the Competent Authority obtained in accordance with the laws.  (ii) The sanctioned plan, layout plan of the proposed project sanctioned by the Competent Planning Authority.  (iii) A declaration, supported by an Affidavit signed by the promoter or any person authorised by the promoter stating that he has a legal title to the land and that the land is free from all encumbrances.  (iv) Proposed floor space index to be consumed aggregating area in Square metres of the open space.  (c) As per Section 4 (3) of the said Act, the Authority shall katkam  13  operationalise a web based online system for submitting application for registration of project. I say that such a Such a website has been operationalised from 01.05.2017. 1 submit that in pursuance of the above said statutory provision, the work of the Authority is web based online basis for Registration of Projects. I submit that on the website of MahaRERA Authority standard operation procedure has been prescribed and the same is available in public domain.  (d) I further submit that so far as information about unregistered project are concerned, standard procedure has been prescribed vide SOP No. 9/2017 dated 24.07.2017, the copy of which is hereto annexed and marked as Exhibit-AR-1. In the said SOP Part (b) deals with the procedure for getting registration of unregistered projects.  (e) 1 submit that in pursuance thereof the Authority has created a separate dedicated email id known as  sourcedetails@maharera.mahaonline.gov.in on which any citizen can submit the information by way of source information regarding Non-Registration of Projects. I submit that based on that Source Information the Technical Officers of the Authority investigate the Information provided by contacting the concerned Promoter. After going through their records if it is found that it is a project liable to be registered under Section 3, orders are being issued for the purpose of registration by imposing penalty for delayed registration as provided under Section 59 of the said Act.  5. The plots purchased by the petitioner bears Plot No.13B and Survey No.138 admeasuring 22000 sq.ft.. at Taluka Lonavala. The information was received by way of Source Information for non-registration by email on 08.01.2018. Thereafter the owner was sent email on the email address provided by the source information, calling upon him to explain the matter. Initially, the owner did not respond. Finally, when he was summoned on 18.06.2018 it transpired that the land in question is Agricultural land. The Sale Deed executed between the Petitioner and original seller shows that the land was Agricultural land. Since the land claimed by the petitioner is not fulfilling the aforesaid criteria for registration as prescribed under Section 4, especially absence of commencement certificate from the Planning Authority, the said project is not eligible for registration, In view of this, it is prayed that the petition be dismissed with costs.\"  15. Thus what MahaRERA undertook before this Court in its Affidavit dated 5 July 2018 was creation of dedicated e-mail id to enable citizens to katkam  14  submit information by way of 'source information' regarding non-registration of projects for it to investigate the same by contacting the concerned promoters. If upon conduct of such investigations, MahaRERA is satisfied that the project is liable to be registered under section 3 of the RERA, it can take action by passing orders directing registration of project by imposing penalties under section 15 of the RERA. Reliance was placed on 'Standard Operating Procedure' issued vide a Circular No. 09 of 2017 on 24 July 2017. When Writ Petition (L) No.908 of 2018 came up before this court on 31 July 2018, the same came to be disposed of recording statement on behalf of MahaRERA that it shall modify/upgrade its software for receiving online complaints in respect of unregistered projects and that complaint tendered by Appellant would be dealt with. The order passed by this Court on 31 July 2018 reads thus:  2. The Petitioner is making a grievance in respect of the failure of the MahaRERA Appellate Authority to take cognizance of the complaints tendered by the complainants in respect of the unregistered project. The counsel appearing for the Respondent No.1 on instructions states that at present the on-line software system is not equipped to entertain the complaints in respect of the projects which are not registered under the RERA Act. It is further stated that necessary modifications / up-gradation of the software will be made within period of 15 days from today. On completion of the process of up-gradation of the software equipped of receiving on-line complaints, in respect of unregistered projects by the MahaRERA within the time stipulated as above, it would be open for the Petitioner to register the complaint in observance of the procedure prescribed in that behalf. The complaint tendered on-line by the Petitioner and other similarly situated complainants, in respect of unregistered projects would be entertained and the same would be dealt with in accordance with the procedure that is being adopted by MahaRERA in respect of disposal katkam  15  of complaints in relation to registered projects. The statement is made by the learned counsel appearing for Respondent No.1 on instructions from Mr.Wani, Administrative officer of MahaRERA who is present before the Court. In view of the statement made as above, the grievance raised in the Petition stands redressed.  3. The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of.\"  16. Appellant complains that despite assuring this court on 31 July 2018 that 'complaint' in respect of unregistered projects would be entertained and dealt with, he was not permitted to lodge such complaint and what is ultimately decided by MahaRERA is only 'source info' registered on MahaRERA's website which was referred paragraph 5 of Affidavit dated 5 July 2018. It is contended by Appellant that a complaint needs to be filed in Form 'A' of the MahaRERA Rules, 2017 whereas no such facility was provided for lodging of complaint in Form 'A'. With the result, what is adjudicated by MahaRERA, according to Appellant, is only 'source information' for the purpose of taking action against unregistered project for registration thereof under section 3 of the RERA. What Appellant expects is adjudication of his rights under sections 12, 18 and 59 of the RERA by imposing penalty, returning the amount with interest and granting compensation to him. He complains that on account of non- availability of facility of lodging complaint under Form 'A', Appellant was neither permitted to raise prayers nor submit supporting documents in support of his grievance. The issue that therefore arises for consideration is whether in respect of unregistered project, an allottee can merely give 'source information' to MahaRERA for taking action under section 3 of the RERA or katkam  16  whether such allottee can file a full-fledged complaint under section 31 of the RERA for seeking reliefs under sections 12, 18 and 59 thereof. To find an answer, it would be necessary to make a quick reference to various provisions of the RERA.  17. Section 3 of the RERA prohibits advertisement, marketing, booking, selling etc. of any plot, apartment or building in any real estate project without registering the same with the Regulatory Authority. First Proviso to Section 3 of the RERA provides for compulsory registration in respect of ongoing projects on the date of commencement of the RERA. Section 3 reads thus:  \"    (1) No promoter shall advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale, or invite persons to purchase in any manner any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project or part of it, in any planning area, without registering the real estate project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority established under this Act:    that projects that are ongoing on the date of commencement of this Act and for which the completion certificate has not been issued, the promoter shall make an application to the Authority for registration of the said project within a period of three months from the date of commencement of this Act:    that if the Authority thinks necessary, in the interest of allottees, for projects which are developed beyond the planning area but with the requisite permission of the local authority, it may, by order, direct the promoter of such project to register with the Authority, and the provisions of this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder, shall apply to such projects from that stage of registration.  (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no registration of the real project shall be required:-  (a) where the area of land proposed to be developed does not exceed five hundred square meters or the number of apartments proposed to be developed does not exceed eight inclusive of all phases:  katkam  17    that if the appropriate Government considers it necessary, it may reduce the threshold below five hundred square meters or eight apartments, as the case may be, inclusive of all phases, for exemption from registration under this Act;  (b) where the promoter has received completion certificate for a real estate project prior to commencement of this Act;  (c) for the purpose of renovation or repair or re-development which does not involve marketing, advertising selling or new allotment of any apartment, plot of building, as the case may be, under the real estate project.   - For the purpose of this section, where the real estate project is to be developed in phases, every such phase shall be considered a stand alone real estate project, and the promoter shall obtain registration under this Act for each phase separately.\"  18. Section 4 of the RERA deals with the manner of registration of real estate projects and mandates every promoter to make an application for registration of real estate project by submitting documents provided in sub- section 2. Section 4 reads thus:    (1) Every promoter shall make an application to the Authority for registration of the real estate project in such form, manner, within such time and accompanied by such fee as may be prescribed.  (2) The promoter shall enclose the following documents along with the application referred to in sub-section (1), namely:-  (a) a brief details of his enterprise including its name, registered address, type of enterprise (proprietorship, societies, partnership companies, competent authority) and the particulars of registration, and the names and photographs of the promoter;  (b) a brief detail of the projects launched by him, in the past five years, whether already completed or being developed as the case may be, including the current status of the said projects, any delay in its completion, details of cases pending, details type of land and payments pending; katkam  18  (c) an authenticated copy of the approvals and commencement certificate from the competent authority obtained in accordance with the laws as may be applicable for the real estate project mentioned in the application, and where the project is proposed to be developed in phases, an authenticated copy of the approvals and commencement certificate from the competent authority for each of such phases;  (d) the sanctioned plan, layout plan and specifications of the proposed project or the phase thereof, and the whole project as sanctioned by the competent authority;  (e) the plan of development works to be executed in the proposed project and the proposed facilities to be provided thereof including fire fighting facilities, drinking water facilities, emergency evacuation services, use of renewable energy;  (f ) the location details of the project, with clear demarcation of land dedicated for the project along with its boundaries including the latitude and longitude of the end points of the project;  (g) proforma of the allotment letter, agreement for sale, and the conveyance deed proposed to be signed with the allottees;  (h) the number, type and the carpet area of apartments for sale in the project along with the area of the exclusive balcony or verandah areas and the exclusive open terrace areas appartment with the apartment, if any,  (i) the number and areas of garage for sale in the project;  (j) the names and addresses of his real estate agents, if any, for the proposed project;  (k) the names and addresses of the contractors, architect, structural engineer, if any and other persons concerned with the development of the proposed project;  (l) a declaration, supported by an affidavit, which shall be signed by the promoter or any person authorised by the promoter, stating:-  (A) that he has a legal title to the land on which the development is proposed along with legally valid documents with authentication of such title, if such land is owned by another person; katkam  19  (B) that the land is free from all encumbrances, or as the case may be details of the encumbrances on such land including any rights, title, interest or name of any party in or over such land along with details:  (C) the time period within which he undertakes to complete the project or phase thereof, as the case may be;  (D) that seventy per cent of the amounts realised for the real estate project from the allottees, from time to time, shall be deposited in a separate account to be maintained in a scheduled bank to cover the cost of construction and the land cost and shall be used only for that purpose:    that the promoter shall withdraw the amounts from the separate account, to cover the cost of the project, in proportion to the percentage of completion of the project:    that the amounts from the separate account shall be withdrawn by the promoter after it is certified by an engineer, an architect and chartered accountant in practice that the withdrawal is in proportion to the percentage of completion of the project:    that the promoter shall get his accounts audited within six months after the end of every financial year by a chartered accountant in practice, and shall produce a statement of accounts duly certified and signed by such chartered accountant and it shall be verified during the audit that the amounts collected for a particular project have been utilised for that project and the withdrawal has been in compliance with the proportion to the percentage of completion of the project.    - For the purpose of this clause, the term \"scheduled bank\" means a bank included in the Second Schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934;  (E) that he shall take all the pending approvals on time, from the competent authorities;  (F) that he has furnished such other documents as may be prescribed by the rules or regulations made under this Act; and  (m) such other information and documents as may be prescribed. katkam  20  (3) The Authority shall operationalise a web based online system for submitting applications for registration of projects within a period of one year from the date of its establishment.\"  19. Thus under section 4 of the RERA, it is mandatory for a promoter to submit various documents enumerated in sub-section (2) for seeking registration of real estate project. Under clauses (c) and (d) of sub-section (2), it is mandatory to produce commencement certificate, sanctioned plan, layout plan etc. sanctioned by the Competent Authority for registration of real estate project. The statutory scheme is such that a real estate project cannot be registered unless appropriate permission for execution thereof are obtained from the Competent Authority. The RERA therefore does not contemplate registration of a project, for which no development permission is granted by Planning Authority.  20. The terms 'promoter' and 'real estate project' have been defined in section 2 (zk) and (zn) of the RERA, which read thus:  \"(zk) \"  means,-  (i) a person who constructs or causes to be constructed an independent building or a building consisting of apartments, or converts an existing building or a part thereof into apartments, for the purpose of selling all or some of the apartments to other persons and includes his assignees; or  (ii) a person who develops land into a project, whether or not the person also constructs structures on any of the plots, for the purpose of selling to other persons all or some of the plots in the said project, whether with or without structures thereon; or  katkam  21  (iii) any development authority or any other public body in respect of allottees of -  (a) buildings or apartments, as the case may be, constructed by such authority or body on lands owned by them or placed at their disposal by the Government; or  (b) plots owned by such authority or body or placed at their disposal by the Government;  (c) for the purpose of selling all or some of the apartments or plots, or  (iv) an apex State level co-operative housing finance society and a primary co-operative housing society which constructs apartments or buildings for its Members or in respect of the allottees of such apartments or buildings; or  (v) any other person who acts himself as a builder, coloniser, contractor, developer, estate developer or by any other name or claims to be acting as the holder of a power of attorney from the owner of the land on which the building or apartment is constructed or plot is developed for sale; or  (vi) such other person who constructs any building or apartment for sale to the general public.    For the purposes of this clause, where the person who constructs or converts a building into apartments or develops a plot for sale and the person who sells apartments or plots are different persons, both of them shall be deemed to be the promoters and shall be jointly liable as such for salt for the functions and responsibilities specified, under this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder;  (zn) \" \" means the development of a building or a building consisting of apartments, or converting an existing building or a part thereof into apartments, or the development of land into plots katkam  22  or apartments, as the case may be, for the purpose of selling all or some of the said apartments or plots or building, as the case may be, and includes the common areas, the development works, all improvements and structures thereon, and all easement, rights and appurtenances belonging thereto;\"  21. Thus plain reading of definitions of terms 'promoter' and 'real estate project' would indicate that development of land into a project by a sub- division thereof into plots is also covered by definition of the terms 'promoter' and 'real estate project'. Section 2(zn) of the RERA does not mandate that the activity of development must be carried out in accordance with development permission granted by Planning Authority for treating such development as 'real estate project'. However, when it comes to making an application for registration under section 4 of the RERA, it is mandatory that sanctioned development permissions are produced before the Regulatory Authority for seeking such registration.  22. Under section 31 of the RERA, any aggrieved person can file a complaint with the Regulatory Authority or Adjudicating Officer for violation or contravention of provisions of the RERA, Rules and Regulations made there under either against promoter, allottee or real estate agent. Section 31 reads thus:  \"    (1) Any aggrieved person may file a complaint with the Authority or the adjudicating officer, as the case may be, for any violation or contravention of the provisions of this Act or the Rules and Regulations made thereunder katkam  23  against any promoter allottee or real estate agent as the case may be.   - For the purpose of this sub-section \"person\" shall include the association of allottees or any voluntary consumer association registered under any law for the time being in force.  (2) The form, manner and fees for filing complaint under sub-section (1) shall be such as may be prescribed.\"  23. Thus complaint under section 31 of the RERA can be entertained only if there is violation or contravention of provisions of the Act, Rules and Regulations. Section 3 of the RERA prohibits marketing or selling of plot, apartment or building in absence of registration of the real estate project. Section 3 provides thus:      (1) No promoter shall advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale, or invite per- sons to purchase in any manner any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project or part of it, in any planning area, without registering the real estate project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority established under this Act:  Provided that projects that are ongoing on the date of commencement of this Act and for which the completion certificate has not been issued, the promoter shall make an application to the Authority for registration of the said project within a pe- riod of three months from the date of commencement of this Act:  Provided further that if the Authority thinks necessary, in the interest of allottees, for projects which are developed beyond the planning area but with the requisite permission of the local authority, it may, by order, direct the promoter of such project to register with the Authority, and the provisions of this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder, shall apply to such projects from that stage of registration.  (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no registration of the real estate project shall be required—  katkam  24  (a) where the area of land proposed to be developed does not exceed five hundred square meters or the number of apartments proposed to be developed does not ex- ceed eight inclusive of all phases:  Provided that, if the appropriate Government considers it necessary, it may, reduce the threshold below five hundred square meters or eight apartments, as the case may be, inclusive of all phases, for exemption from registration under this Act;  (b) where the promoter has received completion certificate for a real estate project prior to commencement of this Act;  (c) for the purpose of renovation or repair or re-development which does not in- volve marketing, advertising selling or new allotment of any apartment, plot or building, as the case may be, under the real estate project. Explanation.—For the purpose of this section, where the real estate project is to be developed in phases, every such phase shall be considered a stand alone real estate project, and the promoter shall obtain registration under this Act for each phase separately.  24. Thus, if any person markets or sales plot or apartment in unregistered project, he contravenes provisions of section 3 of the RERA. Section 59 provides for punishment for non-registration of a project under Section 3 and reads thus:    (1) If any promoter contravenes the provisions of section 3, he shall be liable to a penalty which may extend up to ten per cent. of the estimated cost of the real estate project as determined by the Authority.  (2) If any promoter does not comply with the orders, decisions or directions issued under sub-section (1) or continues to violate the provisions of section 3, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend up to three years or with fine which may extend up to a further ten per cent. of the estimated cost of the real estate project, or with both.  katkam  25  25. Thus, failure to register a project amounts to violation or contravention of provisions of the RERA, which act can be punished under Section 59. Therefore, in strict sense, registration of a project is not a pre- condition for maintaining a complaint under section 31 of the RERA. If section 31 of the RERA is read to mean that complaints only in respect of registered projects can be entertained by Regulatory Authority or Adjudicating Officer, this would mean that no action can be taken by Regulatory Authority against a person who contravenes section 3 of the RERA. In fact, contravention of section 3 necessarily takes place in respect of unregistered project. I am therefore of the view that even in respect of unregistered projects, complaint under section 31 of the RERA would be maintainable.  26. Though complaint under section 31 of the RERA can be filed even in respect of unregistered project, the next issue for consideration is whether the same can be filed and entertained in respect of every unregistered project. Section 3 of the RERA applies to a person who markets or sales plot or apartment in respect of real estate project, which is capable of being registered. The same cannot apply to a project which is incapable of being registered. This is so because when the project itself is incapable of being registered, there is no question of taking action against a person under section 59 of the RERA for non-registration of the project under section 3 of the RERA. Such person obviously would take a defence in proceedings filed for violation of section 3 of the RERA or for imposition of punishment under katkam  26  section 59 of the RERA that the project is not liable or capable of being registered which is why the same is not registered.  27. There may be several reasons why a particular project is not liable or is incapable of being registered. To give some illustrations, the project may not be situated in a planning area, which is a precondition under section 3 of the RERA. Another instances where the project is in respect of land, which does not exceed 500 square meters or involves construction of building with less than 8 apartments, which constitutes an exception under section 3(2)(a) of the RERA. Another instance could be where the transaction is for sale of agricultural land, where no development is proposed, nor layout sanctioned by any Competent Authority. There could also be a situation where a person is cheated with promise to sell a land, which does not even exist. There may be myriad reason why a particular development/project/transaction is incapable and/or not liable to be registered under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the RERA. If a project is not capable of being registered or is not liable to be registered, a person effectuating such project does not contravene any of the provisions of section 3 of the RERA. Therefore, a complaint in respect of project, which is incapable of being registered or which is not liable to be registered, would not lie under section 31 of the RERA.  28. RERA creates a special mechanism for regulating real estate development and   seeks to create fora for allottees to air their grievances against promoters. The remedies provided under RERA are in addition to the civil remedies available to the allottee for enforcement of katkam  27  his/her rights in respect of real estate projects. Thus, mere denial of remedy under RERA would not necessarily result in extinguishment of purchaser's remedies under civil law. Such purchaser can always maintain a civil suit for seeking appropriate relief against person who has sold or agreed to sell any plot or apartment in a project, which is incapable of or not liable to be registered.  29. The statutory scheme of RERA is such that it governs only those projects which are compulsorily registrable. Any project, which is (i) not liable to be registered at all or (ii) may be liable to be registered in future, but is at the crucial time not registrable, would form outside the purview of the RERA. The legislative intention seems to be that a person seeking to purchase a flat or plot at least ensures that there is some development permission for carrying out the development in question. If any person takes the risk of entering into a sale transaction in respect of development, which is incapable of being registered under the RERA Act, such person will have to exercise civil remedies for seeking appropriate reliefs in respect of the transaction in question. Special remedies under RERA are made available only to such allottees who purchase or agree to purchase plot or apartment in a project that is liable to be registered. To illustrate, if a flat purchaser chooses to purchase a flat in a building which contains less than eight flats and if he has any grievance against the developer thereof, he will have to adopt the remedies outside RERA in respect of his grievances. Similar would be the position that of a person (like Appellant), who chooses to enter into purchase transaction in respect of agricultural land, for which no development permission is issued or katkam  28  no lay-out is sanctioned by Competent Authority, because of which the project is incapable of being registered or is not liable to be registered. The remedy in such case would be outside RERA framework. If sale of mere plot of land, which is still agricultural, is brought within the purview of the RERA, the same would mean that every transaction relating to sale of agricultural land would then be governed by RERA.  30. Mr. Gala is at pains to point out that the purchase transaction in the in the present case was effected in the year 2012 i.e. before coming into effect of RERA. He would submit that Appellant could not have foreseen regulation of real estate projects by enactment of RERA or exclusion of projects for which no development permissions are issued from ambit of RERA. While I can only sympathize with Appellant for the position, in which he finds himself, provisions of RERA cannot be selectively interpreted to suit individual grievance of Appellant. Though RERA takes within its fold even ongoing projects under first Proviso to section 3 of the RERA, again such ongoing real estate project must be the one which is capable of or liable to be registered. The Appellant has taken the risk of entering into purchase transaction in respect of land, which was yet to be converted to non- agricultural use. Perusal of the allotment letter issued in the name of Appellant and his mother would indicate that NA permission was to be obtained before April 2013. Appellant and his mother have thus chosen to enter into transaction with Respondent No.1 with their eyes open to the fact that they were agreeing to purchase agricultural land, which was to be converted into non-agricultural use. Since RERA would not apply to Valvan Valley project, Appellant would katkam  29  not be in a position to maintain a complaint under section 31 of the RERA for seeking enforcement of any rights under sections 12, 18 and 59 of the RERA. It appears that Appellant has already filed complaint before the State Consumers Dispute Redressal Commission, and he would be at liberty to pursue the same.  31. Reliance of Mr. Gala on judgment of Division Bench of this Court in    (supra) would not cut any ice. The said judgment does not throw any light on the peculiar issue involved in the present Appeal. Mere retroactive operation of the RERA would not mean that the Regulatory Authority can be clothed with jurisdiction to over projects which are incapable of or not liable to be registered. His reliance on Constitution Bench judgments in  (supra) would again not be any assistance to the case of Appellant. The legislative intention appears to exclude certain developments from the ambit of RERA. Developments involving land admeasuring less than 500 square meters or building containing less than 8 flats or land in respect of which no development permissions are granted are consciously excluded from application of the RERA. By judicial interpretation, it is not possible to read into the RERA, something which has been specifically excluded. The theory of purposive interpretation therefore cannot be pressed into service for reading into the statute something which is not provided for therein.  32. I am therefore of the view that Appellant's complaint under section 31 of the RERA for enforcement of provisions of sections 12, 18 and 59 thereof is katkam  30  not maintainable in respect of Valvan Valley project, which is incapable of being, and not liable to be, registered and is not liable to be registered under  RERA.  33. So far as Lion's Valley project is concerned, no document is placed on record to demonstrate that Appellant is allotted any Plot in the said project. Appellant's grievance in respect of Lion's Valley project is premised on alleged oral agreement with Respondent Nos.2, 5 and 6 for conveyance of four small plots bearing nos.33, 34, 35 and 36 in Lion's Valley project in lieu of Plot No.13-B in Valvan Valley project. It is Appellant's contention that development permissions have been issued in respect of Lion's Valley project, but the same has still not been registered. If this is the case, the Appellant is free to agitate his grievances in respect of non-registration of Lion's Valley project. In fact, the Appellate Tribunal has granted specific liberty to the Appellant to do so under clause (iii) of operative portion of its order.  34. After considering the overall conspectus of the present case, I do not find any patent error in the concurrent findings recorded by the MahaRERA and Appellate Tribunal in their respective orders.  35. The substantial question is accordingly answered by holding that, having regard to provisions of Section 31 of the RERA, MahaRERA and Appellate Tribunal are justified in refusing to entertain the complaint of Appellant lodged against the Respondent-Promoter for contravention of the katkam  31  provisions of Section 3 for punishment under Section 59, on the ground that the project was not registered as a Real Estate Project under Section 3.  36. Appellant is not liable to maintain a complaint under section 31 of the RERA in respect of Valvan Valley project. He has already been granted liberty to take appropriate steps in respect of Lion's Valley project. Appellant would also be at liberty to exercise all his remedies in respect of his alleged rights for allotment of plot, return of consideration, payment of interest and compensation in respect of both Valvan Valley project as well as Lion's Valley project by filing proceedings before appropriate forum. Nothing observed in the present judgment shall come in the way of Appellant exercising such remedies.  37. Leaving open all the contentions on merits, the Second Appeal is dismissed. There shall be no orders as to costs.  38. Interim Application also stands disposed of.    katkam  32"},

HAVING  OFFICE AT: DB CENTRAL, MAULANA AZAD  ROAD, RANGWALA COMPOUND, JACOB  CIRCLE, MAHALAXMI EAST,  MUMBAI - 11      FOR THE APPELLANT : FOR THE COMPLAINANTS : MR. MOHIT  BHANSALI, ADVOCATE  FOR THE RESPONDENT : FOR M/S NEELKAMAL : MR. PRAVIN BAHADUR,  ADVOCATE      1. There are two sets of Appeal one has been filed by the Complainants broadly coming up for enhancement and some ancillary reliefs that have been partly allowed by the State 14  Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra and the prayer is that the State Commission has committed an error in not accepting the entire contentions of the Complainant inspite of having recording the findings deficiency in service on the part of the Builders.  2. The Builders have filed another set of Appeals which has been filed with some delay. The delay is approximately 292 days in all the Appeals.  3. When the arguments commenced one of the issues which needed to be dealt with at the outset was of the delay condonation as prayed by the learned Counsel of the Opposite Party / Builders. He submits that since all the Appeals arise out of the common Order dated 09.02.2022, therefore keeping in view the merits of the Appeals that have arisen in the Appeals filed by the Builders, the delay deserves to be condoned and both the set of Appeals should be heard simultaneously. Learned Counsel for the Complainant submits that the delay is inordinate, huge and unexplained and therefore the question of condoning the delay in the connected Appeals filed by the Builders should not be condoned and the Application for Condonation of Delay should be rejected. An objection to the same has also been filed and arguments have also been advanced on the delay condonation Application at outset.  4. Mr. Pravin Bahadur, learned Counsel for the Builders/ Opposite Party have cited a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of     and in     and a matter decided by the National Commission in     have also been placed before the Bench to urge that keeping in view the merits of the Appeal and the contentions advanced questioning the correctness of the Impugned Order by the Complainant themselves the delay deserves to be condoned and the Appeals should be heard on merits.  5. Learned Counsel for the Complainant however through the Written Arguments submitted by him to the delay condonation Application opposes the same and has relied on the following five judgments to urge that delay should not be condoned keeping in view the unexplained delay and without any proof of sufficient cause:      a.      b.      c.      d.      e. 15  6. He therefore submits that this Commission being a statutory Commission the purpose of consumers approaching a Consumer Forum would be defeated in case any leniency is shown to the defaulters / Builders as in the present case involved. He therefore contends that no discretion should be exercised in respect of the delay which has been prayed for.  7. Coming to the facts of the present Appeal, delay Applications filed in these Appeals by the Builders in his set of Appeals, it is evident that the Impugned Order dated 09.02.2022, the Complainants who have sought enhancements very promptly filed the Appeals on 27.04.2022 on which notices were issued on 26.05.2022. The office report indicates that service was affected on the Opposite Party / Builders on 26.07.2022. It is therefore clear that within the close proximity of time of the issuance of the notice in the Appeals filed by the Complainants, the service of notice on the Builders was completed and they were fully aware of the pendency of the Appeals filed by the Complainants. Thus, the material and the entire litigation that has traveled up to this Commission will be presumed to be in the knowledge of the builders upon the service of the notice as indicated aforesaid.  8. However, while filed the Application for Condonation of Delay, the only explanation given is contained in the Paragraph No. -4 thereof which is extracted here as under:-                                        9. On a perusal of the said paragraph, the entire sufficiency of the cause is sought to be based on a chronological narrative of the shifting of the office of the Company and change of legal professionals and the team assisting in this case. Unfortunately, the said explanation does not in any way indicate as to what prevented them from approaching this Forum when they had already put to notice in the Appeals filed by the Complainant after July, 2022. 16  10. Admittedly, the Appeals filed by the Builders were registered on 07.02.2023. There is an absolute silence as to what prevented them from approaching the Forum in filing these Appeals between July, 2022 and February, 2023. Learned Counsel for the Complainant is therefore right in his submissions that there is an explanation wanting in this regard and is an unexplained delay.  10. However while considering the issue of delay a very interesting argument has been advanced on the strength of one of the judgments cited at the bar which has been relied on by learned Counsel by both the Parties and that is in the case of      A perusal of the said judgments impels the reproduction of the relevant paragraphs on which reliance have been made namely paragraph No. 20, 21 and 22 of the said judgment which are extracted here as under:                                                       17          12. The ratio of the aforesaid judgment therefore leans in favour of not condoning the delay liberally but at the same time permits the consideration of merits of a litigation including an Appeal in the event the merits are strong enough to be dealt with presumably in order to prevent any miscarriage of justice.  13. However, in the opinion of this Bench such discretion for condoning the delay should be exercised judiciously and not capriciously and not without any foundation. For this one can refer to the judgment of     14. Keeping in view the ratio of the judgment in the case of     and touching upon the merits it is more than obvious that two sets of Appeal have been filed, one by the Complainant contending that the Order passed by the State Commission is erroneous in so far as it fails to grant the entire relief and other set of Appeals is filed by the Builders contending that any relief granted was inadmissible as on law as well as on facts.  15. In order to appreciate the aforesaid contentions both the learned Counsel for the Parties have advanced their submissions and it is worth noting the contents of the Order of the State Commission in order to arrive at the correct conclusion. The State Commission proceeds to narrate facts in four Paragraphs and Paragraph No.-6 is the findings recorded.  16. The said part of the Order is extracted here as under:  \"6. …………In our opinion, the rulings relied upon by the opponent are not applicable to the present case, since facts in the present case are different. Contention raised on behalf of complainant regarding rent and interest on loan amount etc., cannot be accepted since those are not 6 (CC/16/887) pleaded and prayed in the complaint. Hence, we answer point Nos.1 and 2 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order-  1] Consumer complaint is hereby partly allowed.  2] Opponent is directed to handover legal possession of flat in the project 'Orchid Ozone', in Building No.10, bearing No.1408, 14th floor, admeasuring 418.94 sq.ft. carpet area to the complainant after execution of agreement, after accepting balance amount of consideration, if any within a period of three months from the date of passing of this order.  3] Opponent is directed to pay amount of Rs.2,00,000/- to the complainant towards compensation for mental and physical agony. 18  4] Opponent is directed to pay amount of Rs.50,000/- to the complainant towards costs of litigation.  5] Opponent is directed to comply with the aforesaid order within a period of 60 days from the date of passing of this order. Else, this amount shall carry interest @12% p.a. from the date of passing of this order till entire realisation of amount by the complainant. Copy of this order be supplied to both the parties.\"  17. It is this portion of the Order which has been assailed in both sets of Appeals.  18. Learned Counsel for both the Parties could not dispute that the findings which have been recorded are not based on the appreciation of the documents and the pleadings that were placed before the Commission. However, learned Counsel for the Complainant therefore submits that so far as the findings pertaining to the Complainants acceptance of the claim is concerned they can be correlated to the pleadings and evidence on record.  19. When a Judgment proceeds on consideration on merits it has to deal with any specific findings with regards to Evidence and pleadings on record. Paragraph No. 6 is a recital of conclusions without any discussion of any of the Evidence on record. In this view of the matter it is difficult for this Commission to decide as to which part of the pleadings and evidence placed before the State Commission had been impelled to record the findings either way. Consequently in the absence of any such materials so as to segregate the findings either to support or find a defect in the Order, the only reasonable conclusion drawn is that the Impugned Order proceeds on non-consideration of relevant materials without giving any reasons or even giving the reasonings. Consequently, the Order being sketchy and not attending the details of the claim made by other side it is found there is strong merit in both sets of the Appeal.  20. Consequently, applying the principles aforesaid, the delay in the Appeals filed by the Builders / Opposite Party deserves to be condoned. Accordingly, the Condonation of Delay Applications are allowed. The delay is condoned and the Appeals filed by them shall be treated within time.  21. However, all the reasons recorded therein above and having found the Impugned Order to be insufficient in reasons and the Impugned Order dated 09.02.2022 passed by the Maharashtra State Commission are set aside. Both set of Appeals are allowed. The matters are remitted back to the State Commission for deciding the Complaints afresh after giving the opportunities to the learned Counsel in accordance with law.  22. At this stage, learned Counsel for the Complainants submits that a time frame be provided so that the matter is disposed of at the earliest. The request is accepted. The State Commission is requested to decide the Complaints expeditiously preferably within three months.  23. The Appeals are allowed with the aforesaid directions. 19  .........................J     20"},

There are two sets of Appeal one has been filed by the Complainants broadly coming up for enhancement and some ancillary reliefs that have been partly allowed by the State 14  Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra and the prayer is that the State Commission has committed an error in not accepting the entire contentions of the Complainant inspite of having recording the findings deficiency in service on the part of the Builders.  2. The Builders have filed another set of Appeals which has been filed with some delay. The delay is approximately 292 days in all the Appeals.  3. When the arguments commenced one of the issues which needed to be dealt with at the outset was of the delay condonation as prayed by the learned Counsel of the Opposite Party / Builders. He submits that since all the Appeals arise out of the common Order dated 09.02.2022, therefore keeping in view the merits of the Appeals that have arisen in the Appeals filed by the Builders, the delay deserves to be condoned and both the set of Appeals should be heard simultaneously. Learned Counsel for the Complainant submits that the delay is inordinate, huge and unexplained and therefore the question of condoning the delay in the connected Appeals filed by the Builders should not be condoned and the Application for Condonation of Delay should be rejected. An objection to the same has also been filed and arguments have also been advanced on the delay condonation Application at outset.  4. Mr. Pravin Bahadur, learned Counsel for the Builders/ Opposite Party have cited a judgment of the Apex Court in the case of     and in     and a matter decided by the National Commission in     have also been placed before the Bench to urge that keeping in view the merits of the Appeal and the contentions advanced questioning the correctness of the Impugned Order by the Complainant themselves the delay deserves to be condoned and the Appeals should be heard on merits.  5. Learned Counsel for the Complainant however through the Written Arguments submitted by him to the delay condonation Application opposes the same and has relied on the following five judgments to urge that delay should not be condoned keeping in view the unexplained delay and without any proof of sufficient cause:      a.      b.      c.      d.      e. 15  6. He therefore submits that this Commission being a statutory Commission the purpose of consumers approaching a Consumer Forum would be defeated in case any leniency is shown to the defaulters / Builders as in the present case involved. He therefore contends that no discretion should be exercised in respect of the delay which has been prayed for.  7. Coming to the facts of the present Appeal, delay Applications filed in these Appeals by the Builders in his set of Appeals, it is evident that the Impugned Order dated 09.02.2022, the Complainants who have sought enhancements very promptly filed the Appeals on 27.04.2022 on which notices were issued on 26.05.2022. The office report indicates that service was affected on the Opposite Party / Builders on 26.07.2022. It is therefore clear that within the close proximity of time of the issuance of the notice in the Appeals filed by the Complainants, the service of notice on the Builders was completed and they were fully aware of the pendency of the Appeals filed by the Complainants. Thus, the material and the entire litigation that has traveled up to this Commission will be presumed to be in the knowledge of the builders upon the service of the notice as indicated aforesaid.  8. However, while filed the Application for Condonation of Delay, the only explanation given is contained in the Paragraph No. -4 thereof which is extracted here as under:-                                        9. On a perusal of the said paragraph, the entire sufficiency of the cause is sought to be based on a chronological narrative of the shifting of the office of the Company and change of legal professionals and the team assisting in this case. Unfortunately, the said explanation does not in any way indicate as to what prevented them from approaching this Forum when they had already put to notice in the Appeals filed by the Complainant after July, 2022. 16  10. Admittedly, the Appeals filed by the Builders were registered on 07.02.2023. There is an absolute silence as to what prevented them from approaching the Forum in filing these Appeals between July, 2022 and February, 2023. Learned Counsel for the Complainant is therefore right in his submissions that there is an explanation wanting in this regard and is an unexplained delay.  10. However while considering the issue of delay a very interesting argument has been advanced on the strength of one of the judgments cited at the bar which has been relied on by learned Counsel by both the Parties and that is in the case of      A perusal of the said judgments impels the reproduction of the relevant paragraphs on which reliance have been made namely paragraph No. 20, 21 and 22 of the said judgment which are extracted here as under:                                                       17          12. The ratio of the aforesaid judgment therefore leans in favour of not condoning the delay liberally but at the same time permits the consideration of merits of a litigation including an Appeal in the event the merits are strong enough to be dealt with presumably in order to prevent any miscarriage of justice.  13. However, in the opinion of this Bench such discretion for condoning the delay should be exercised judiciously and not capriciously and not without any foundation. For this one can refer to the judgment of     14. Keeping in view the ratio of the judgment in the case of     and touching upon the merits it is more than obvious that two sets of Appeal have been filed, one by the Complainant contending that the Order passed by the State Commission is erroneous in so far as it fails to grant the entire relief and other set of Appeals is filed by the Builders contending that any relief granted was inadmissible as on law as well as on facts.  15. In order to appreciate the aforesaid contentions both the learned Counsel for the Parties have advanced their submissions and it is worth noting the contents of the Order of the State Commission in order to arrive at the correct conclusion. The State Commission proceeds to narrate facts in four Paragraphs and Paragraph No.-6 is the findings recorded.  16. The said part of the Order is extracted here as under:  \"6. …………In our opinion, the rulings relied upon by the opponent are not applicable to the present case, since facts in the present case are different. Contention raised on behalf of complainant regarding rent and interest on loan amount etc., cannot be accepted since those are not 6 (CC/16/887) pleaded and prayed in the complaint. Hence, we answer point Nos.1 and 2 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order-  1] Consumer complaint is hereby partly allowed.  2] Opponent is directed to handover legal possession of flat in the project 'Orchid Ozone', in Building No.10, bearing No.1408, 14th floor, admeasuring 418.94 sq.ft. carpet area to the complainant after execution of agreement, after accepting balance amount of consideration, if any within a period of three months from the date of passing of this order.  3] Opponent is directed to pay amount of Rs.2,00,000/- to the complainant towards compensation for mental and physical agony. 18  4] Opponent is directed to pay amount of Rs.50,000/- to the complainant towards costs of litigation.  5] Opponent is directed to comply with the aforesaid order within a period of 60 days from the date of passing of this order. Else, this amount shall carry interest @12% p.a. from the date of passing of this order till entire realisation of amount by the complainant. Copy of this order be supplied to both the parties.\"  17. It is this portion of the Order which has been assailed in both sets of Appeals.  18. Learned Counsel for both the Parties could not dispute that the findings which have been recorded are not based on the appreciation of the documents and the pleadings that were placed before the Commission. However, learned Counsel for the Complainant therefore submits that so far as the findings pertaining to the Complainants acceptance of the claim is concerned they can be correlated to the pleadings and evidence on record.  19. When a Judgment proceeds on consideration on merits it has to deal with any specific findings with regards to Evidence and pleadings on record. Paragraph No. 6 is a recital of conclusions without any discussion of any of the Evidence on record. In this view of the matter it is difficult for this Commission to decide as to which part of the pleadings and evidence placed before the State Commission had been impelled to record the findings either way. Consequently in the absence of any such materials so as to segregate the findings either to support or find a defect in the Order, the only reasonable conclusion drawn is that the Impugned Order proceeds on non-consideration of relevant materials without giving any reasons or even giving the reasonings. Consequently, the Order being sketchy and not attending the details of the claim made by other side it is found there is strong merit in both sets of the Appeal.  20. Consequently, applying the principles aforesaid, the delay in the Appeals filed by the Builders / Opposite Party deserves to be condoned. Accordingly, the Condonation of Delay Applications are allowed. The delay is condoned and the Appeals filed by them shall be treated within time.  21. However, all the reasons recorded therein above and having found the Impugned Order to be insufficient in reasons and the Impugned Order dated 09.02.2022 passed by the Maharashtra State Commission are set aside. Both set of Appeals are allowed. The matters are remitted back to the State Commission for deciding the Complaints afresh after giving the opportunities to the learned Counsel in accordance with law.  22. At this stage, learned Counsel for the Complainants submits that a time frame be provided so that the matter is disposed of at the earliest. The request is accepted. The State Commission is requested to decide the Complaints expeditiously preferably within three months.  23. The Appeals are allowed with the aforesaid directions. 19  .........................J     20"},

Heard learned Counsel for the appellant and learned Counsel for the respondent. 1 of 5  2. Admit on the following substantial question of law:-  \"Whether a sole member of the Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal can decide any appeal or application for condonation of delay or any application contemplated under the provisions of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 or the same has to be heard and can be disposed of only by the Bench comprising of two members including the judicial member?\"  3. The appeal is heard finally by consent of learned Counsel for the parties.  4. A Single Member of RERA Tribunal, by the impugned order dated 25 September, 2019 condoned a delay of two days by a reasoned order.  5. The issue involved in this appeal is purely covered by a decision rendered by the learned Single Judge of this Court in case of  ) No.14845 of 2019 decided on 1 October, 2019 (Coram: R.D. Dhanuka, J.). Learned Single Judge was of the 2 of 5  opinion that from the plain reading of Section 43 (3) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2017 (for short 'RERA'), it is clear that the sole member of the said Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to dispose of appeal or any application including even an application for condonation of delay in filing appeal. It is held that the order passed by the administrative member sitting single is without jurisdiction and, therefore, the same was set aside.  6. The same issue has come before another learned Single Judge of this Court in Second Appeal (Stamp) No.14061 of 2019 in case of Larsen and  . The learned Single Judge (Coram: M.S. Karnik, J.) has taken a similar view while deciding the appeal on 17 October, 2019.  7. It would be convenient to reproduce sub-section-3 of section-43 of the RERA Act which reads thus;  \"43.(1)….. (2)….  (3)Every bench of Appellate Tribunal shall consist of at least one Judicial Member and one Administrative or Technical Member\". 3 of 5  8. Learned Counsel for respective parties are ad idem on this point. I, therefore, see no reason to take any other view as has been rightly taken in the decisions rendered hereinabove. The present appeal, therefore, succeeds and is accordingly allowed with no order as to costs.  9. The impugned order dated 25 September, 2019 passed by the RERA Tribunal in Misc. Application No.92 of 2019 is quashed and set aside.  10. The parties are remitted to the RERA Tribunal for hearing the same afresh on its own merits and in accordance with law.  11. All contentions of the parties on merits are kept open.  12. The RERA Tribunal is requested to hear the appeal as expeditiously as possible taking into consideration pendency of the appeals on it's file.  13. The parties shall appear before the RERA Tribunal on 18 December, 2020 at 11.00 a.m. 4 of 5  14. In view of the disposal of the Second Appeal, Interim Application [Stamp] No.2341 of 2019 does not survive and stands disposed of.  15.

Heard finally, at the stage of admission itself, with the consent of learned counsel for the Appellant and Respondents.  2. Admit.  3. These three Appeals are preferred, under Section 58 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, (for short, \"RERA\"), by Lavasa Corporation, which is developing a Township Project to construct 'Lake Views' and which is registered under the RERA.  4. These Appeals are raising the common questions of law as to 'whether the provisions of the RERA would apply in case of an 'Agreement to Lease'?'; particularly in the facts of the present case, 'whether the definition of the term\"Promoter\", as provided under 3  Section 2(zk) in the RERA, would include a 'Lessor', and 'whether the remedy provided to the 'Allottees' under Section 18 of the RERA can be available only against the 'Promoter', or, in that sense, also against a 'Lessor'?'  5. The Appellants are aggrieved by the three separate orders passed by the Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal in three separate Appeals filed by the Respondents, under Section 43(5) of the RERA, against the orders passed by the 'Adjudicating Authority', under Section 18 of the said Act. By the impugned orders, the Appellate Tribunal has set aside the orders passed by the 'Adjudicating Authority' and held that, the provisions of the RERA are applicable even in case of 'Agreement of Lease' in the present case and, therefore, the Adjudicating Member of the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority has jurisdiction to entertain the complaints filed by the Respondents. It was held so, despite the fact that, according to the Appellant, relationship between the Appellant and Respondents is of 'Lessor' and 'Lessee' and there is no sale and/or absolute transfer of right, title and interest in favour of the Respondents with respect to their respective apartments.  6. The factual matrix of the case, in which these questions are raised, can be depicted as follows :-  Respondents claim themselves to be the bonafide purchasers of 4  their respective apartments in the projects/buildings known as \"Brook View\", which is being constructed at Village Dasve, Taluka Mulshi; \"Belshore\", which is being constructed at Bhugaon Taluka; and \"Lake View\", which is being constructed at Mulshi Taluka, respectively, in Pune District by the Appellant herein. In pursuance of the negotiations between the parties, the 'Agreements of Lease' came to be executed between them on various dates in the years 2014, 2013 and 2010, respectively. As per the said 'Agreements', the Respondents have booked the apartments on the basis of lease for the period of 999 years in the Township Scheme of the Appellant. They had paid most of the consideration amount, which is, approximately, to the extent of 80% of the sale price. They have also paid substantial amount towards the stamp-duty and the registration charges.  7. As per the 'Agreements of Lease' executed between the parties, the project was to be completed and the possession of the apartments was to be handed over to the Respondents within a period of 24 months. After waiting bonafidely for all these six to seven years for getting the project completed and after making several enquiries with the Appellant about the progress of the said project, the Respondents found that there are no chances of the project being completed in a near future. Hence, after the Appellant registered itself with the RERA, Respondents approached the 'Adjudicating Authority' under the MahaRERA with an application, 5  under Section 18 of the RERA, for compensation with interest for every month of the delay in handing over possession of the apartments and for various other reliefs, to which they are entitled under the RERA.  8. Appellant, however, on its appearance before the Adjudicating Authority, challenged the very applicability of the provisions of the RERA to the 'Agreements of Lease' entered into by the parties contending inter alia that, the Respondents are the 'Lessees', as the 'Agreements' entered into between the parties are clearly the 'Agreements of Lease' and not an 'Agreement of Sale'. Therefore, such 'Agreements of Lease' being specifically excluded from the ambit of the RERA, the Adjudicating Authority under the RERA has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaints.  9. After perusing the complaints, 'Agreements of Lease' and the provisions of RERA, the Adjudicating Authority was pleased to hold that, as the definition of the 'Allottee', as given in Section 2(d) of the RERA, does not include a person, to whom such plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, is given \"on rent\"; and as the definition of the 'Promoter', as given in Section 2(zk) of the RERA, includes only the person, who has constructed or caused to be constructed a building or apartment for the \"purpose of selling\" and thereby excluding from its purview the \"purpose of lease\" and in this case, as admittedly, the 6  'Agreements' executed by the Appellant with the Respondents are the 'Agreements of Lease', such 'Agreements' cannot fall within the purview of the provisions of RERA. Hence, as the remedy under Section 18 of the RERA is available only, against the Promoter's failure, under Section 31 of the said Act, which confers jurisdiction on the Adjudicating Authority, only when there is violation or contravention of the provisions of the RERA or the Rules and Regulations made thereunder, it was held that, the MahaRERA has no jurisdiction to entertain the present complaints or the dispute and, accordingly, dismissed the complaints for want of jurisdiction.  10. When Respondents challenged this order of the Adjudicating Authority before the Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, the Appellate Authority, however, after perusal of the 'Agreement of Lease' as a whole and after considering the object and purpose of the RERA, was pleased to hold that, though the 'Agreements' between the parties are titled as 'Lease Agreements', in effect, they are the agreements of \"absolute sale\" and, therefore, the provisions of the RERA will be applicable. The Appellate Tribunal also held that, the Appellant has got itself registered under the provisions of the RERA and, therefore, now it is precluded or estopped from contending that the provisions of the RERA are not applicable thereto. In this respect, the Appellate Tribunal has relied upon the 'Principle of Estoppel', laid down in Section 115 of the 7  Evidence Act and, thus, allowed the Appeals and held that the 'Adjudicating Officer' of MahaRERA has jurisdiction to entertain the complaints on its merits. The matters were, therefore, directed to be placed before the 'Adjudicating Officer' of MahaRERA, to be decided in accordance with law.  11. While challenging these orders of the Appellate Tribunal, the submission of learned counsel for the Appellant is that, the impugned orders are clearly against the express provisions of the RERA and hence, they cannot be sustainable in law. To substantiate this submission, learned counsel for the Appellant has taken this Court initially through various clauses in the 'Agreements of Lease', including the title thereof, to submit that, such 'Agreements' in no way can be called as 'Agreements of Sale'. It is submitted by him that, the parties had entered into the 'Agreements of Lease', knowing fully well that those were the 'Agreements' to book the apartment \"on lease for 999 years\" in the project of the Appellant. The definitions given in the 'Agreements of Lease' also clearly indicate and prove that it was purely a transaction of lease and not of sale. It is submitted that, the 'Agreements' nowhere use the terms 'sale', 'sale-consideration' or 'purchase price', but, the 'lease' and 'rent'. The term 'Rent' is defined to mean, 'the yearly rent amount payable by the customer to the Appellant-Lavasa, once the lease is actually granted in respect of the apartment'. As per Clause No.5.1 of the 8  Agreement, the \"Annual Lease Rent\" is fixed at Rs.1/- only, for the said apartment. Clause No.7 defines the \"Rent\" as \"yearly rent\" of Rs.1/- for the lease of the said apartment'. Clause No.9.1 of the Agreement also states that, possession was to be given, subject to the Respondents making timely payment of the deposit amount against the \"lease premium\" installments for the ultimate \"grant of lease\" of the said apartment.  12. Thus, it is submitted that, the reading of the 'Agreement' in its entirety is more than sufficient to prove that, it was an 'Agreement of Lease' and in no way an 'Agreement of Sale', so as to attract the provisions of the RERA. It is submitted that, even the Respondents themselves are aware that it is an 'Agreement of Lease' and in their complaints filed before the MahaRERA, they have stated in paragraph No.4(A)-1 that, it was an 'Agreement of Lease' and they are the genuine and bonafide 'Lessees' in respect of the apartments. They have further stated in paragraph No.3 of the complaint that, they had agreed to book an apartment \"on lease for 999 years\". In paragraph No.5 of the complaint, they have further stated that, it was an 'Agreement of Lease' of apartment with the Appellant for booking of the said apartment. In paragraph No.9 thereof, they had further stated that, they had called upon the Appellant to comply with the 'Agreement for Lease' of apartment, as mandated in law. Thus, it is submitted that, when as per 9  the own case of the Respondents, they had entered into 'Agreements of Lease' with the Appellant and now also, they are seeking compliance of the said 'Agreements of Lease', the question of attracting the provisions of the RERA does not arise in the present case.  13. In this respect, learned counsel for the Appellant has also relied upon the definition of the term 'Promoter', as given in Section 2(zk) of the RERA, which contemplates a person, who constructs or caused to be constructed an apartment \"for the purpose of selling\". It is urged that, the very definition of the term 'Allottee', as given in Section 2(d) of the RERA, specifically provides that, Allottee does not include a person to whom such plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, \"is given on rent\". Even the definition of the term 'Real Estate Project', as given in Section 2(zn) of RERA, means the development of a building or a building consisting of apartments for the \"purpose of selling\" all or some of the said apartments. Hence, it follows that, the Legislature has made its intention very clear of excluding from the purview of the provisions of the RERA an 'Agreement of Lease' or the case where the premises are given on rent.  14. Here in the case, it is, therefore, submitted that the remedy under Section 18 of the RERA, which is available only against a \"Promoter\", cannot be available against the Appellant, who is not the \"Promoter\" and 10  when the Respondents are not the \"Purchasers\" or the \"Allottees\", but the \"Lessees\". According to him, even combined reading of Sections 18 and 31 of the RERA, which provide for filing of complaints under Section 18 of the said Act to the Adjudicating Officer, makes it clear that the Adjudicating Officer can entertain such complaint, only if the complaint is filed under Section 18 of the RERA. Here in the case, as the complaint does not come within the parameters of Section 18 of the RERA, the Respondents not being the 'Allottees', nor the Appellant is the 'Promoter', nor it is a 'Real Estate Project', undertaken for the purpose of \"selling\" of the apartments, the 'Adjudicating Officer' had rightly held that, it has no jurisdiction to entertain such complaints filed by the Respondents.  15. It is urged that, the Appellate Tribunal has, however, misconstrued the provisions of the RERA, misread the contents of the 'Agreement of Lease' and thereby violated the provisions of the RERA by expanding its scope. It is submitted that, the legislative intent was very clear of not to apply the provisions of the RERA to the 'Agreement of Lease'. However, the Appellate Authority has gone beyond the legislative intent and interpreted the provisions of the RERA to include even the 'Agreement of Lease'. Hence, according to learned counsel for the Appellant, the impugned orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal call for interference in these Second Appeals.  16. Secondly, it is submitted that, the Appellate Authority has 11  committed an error in invoking the 'Principle of Estoppel', as laid down in Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. It is urged that, the project undertaken by the Appellant in the name of \"Lavasa\" is a very huge and large project and the registration of the project is sought only in respect of some of its components. Moreover, registration of the project under the RERA cannot be a sole test to invoke the provisions of the said Act. According to learned counsel for the Appellant, if registration under the RERA can be the sole test for applying the provisions of the said Act, then, applying the same logic, the RERA will not be made applicable to the projects, which are not registered. That cannot be the intention of the Legislature. Therefore, according to him, merely because the Appellant has sought registration under the RERA, it is not precluded or estopped from raising the contention that, as the 'Agreements' executed with the Respondents are that of 'Agreements of Lease' and the status of the Respondents is only of a 'Lessee' and not that of a 'Purchaser', their complaints cannot be entertained under the RERA. It is submitted that, as those complaints are clearly under Section 18 of the RERA and to these Respondents, therefore, RERA cannot be made applicable and hence, the Adjudicating Authority, under Section 31 of RERA, has no jurisdiction to entertain those complaints. According to learned counsel for the Appellant, on this score also, the Appellate Tribunal has committed an error in law, which is required to be rectified in these Second Appeals. 12  17. Per contra, learned counsel for the Respondents has taken this Court through the 'Objects and Reasons' of the RERA and also its various provisions to advance his submission that, it is applicable wherever the project is undertaken for development of the property and for handing over possession of the apartment, after its development, on payment of consideration amount. Here in the case, it is submitted that, the 'Agreement of Lease' is to be read as a whole to understand its real purport and object. According to him, the various clauses in the 'Agreement'; especially the clause relating to the period of lease and also the payment of consideration amount, clearly go to prove that the 'Agreement' was for long term duration of lease, to the extent of 999 years; thereby clearly indicating that, it was an 'Agreement of Sale' and not an 'Agreement of Lease', though it was titled as such. In his submission, mere title or nomenclature of 'Agreement' cannot determine its real nature. Here in the case, it is urged that, more than 80% of the consideration amount is already paid to the Appellant. Even the stamp- duty and the registration charges are paid on the purchase price of the apartments. Therefore, in the real sense, it is an 'Agreement of Sale'.  18. It is further submitted by learned counsel for the Respondents that, the definition of the term \"Allottee\", as given in Section 2(d) of the RERA, in relation to a real estate project means, a person to whom a plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, has been allotted, sold 13  (whether as freehold or leasehold) or \"otherwise transferred\" by the Promoter. Thus, it is submitted that, this definition includes not only the freehold plots, but also the leasehold plots. It is urged that, the definitions of the terms 'Promoter' and 'Real Estate Project', as given in Sections 2(zk) and 2(zn) of the RERA, are also required to be read in that context, as they clearly makes the intention of the Legislature clear that the Legislature not only wanted the sale to be included, but also any other transaction relating to leasehold.  19. In this case, according to learned counsel for the Respondents, in the real sense, the apartment is not only \"allotted\", but \"sold\" to the Respondents, though the 'Agreement' may have been titled as that of a lease. Moreover, it is urged that, the terms of the 'Agreement' make it clear that, the 'Lease-Deed' is yet to be executed. The rent fixed @ Rs.1/- only, also makes it abundantly clear that, it was an 'Agreement of Sale' and not an 'Agreement of Lease' as such.  20. In this respect, learned counsel for the Respondents has also brought to the attention of this Court the definition of the 'Lease Premium', as given in the 'Agreement of Lease', meaning thereby, 'the premium consideration payable in respect of lease of the apartment'. It is urged that, Clause No.5.1 uses the term 'Customer' and not the 'Lessee' in the context of the Respondents. 14  21. According to learned counsel for the Respondents, all the terms and conditions of the 'Agreement of Lease' are pari materia to the terms and conditions of the 'Agreement', which is executed under the Maharashtra Ownership Flats (Regulation of the Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer) Act, 1963, (for short, \"MOFA\"). In this respect, he has drawn attention of this Court to Clause No.10, which deals with 'Common Amenities and Facilities' and which, according to him, is the classic clause in the 'Agreement' executed under MOFA. Even Clause No.13 thereof relating to 'Statutory Payments' is also found often in the 'Agreement' executed under the MOFA. In his opinion and submission, therefore, here in the case, the intention of the parties was very much clear as to the \"sale\" of the said apartment by the Appellant to the Respondents. Hence, in no way, it can be called as an 'Agreement of Lease', though it is titled as such.  22. Moreover, according to him, if the Appellant has subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the RERA by registering under the RERA, which fact is not disputed, then Appellant cannot blow hot and cold at the same time by saying that, the Adjudicating Authority under the RERA has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint filed under Section 18 of the RERA. It is urged by him that, the provisions of the RERA are beneficial both to the 'Allottee' and also to the 'Promoter'. If the Appellant, in its capacity as 'Promoter', is availing the benefits given under the RERA, 15  then, under Section 115 of the Evidence Act, Appellant is estopped from contending that the 'Adjudicating Authority' has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaints made under Section 18 of the RERA.  23. As regards the contention of the Appellant that, only some components of the project were registered under the RERA, it is pointed out that, the 'Registration Certificate' does not reflect so. Though under the RERA, there is a specific provision for registration of only part of the project, the Appellant has registered the entire project under the RERA and availed the benefits thereunder. Now by refusing to submit itself to the jurisdiction of the 'Adjudicating Authority' under the RERA, the Appellant is, as good as, calling upon the said Authority not to consider, ignore or revoke its registration. It is submitted that, under the RERA, there is a separate 'Authority' for registration and revocation of the registration. It cannot be done by the 'Adjudicating Authority'. The 'Adjudicating Authority' cannot go behind the 'Registration Certificate' and hold that, the provisions of the RERA are not applicable to the Appellant. According to learned counsel for the Respondents, therefore, there is a great dichotomy in the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the Appellant, which cannot be upheld at all. Therefore, the impugned order passed by the Appellate Tribunal, holding that the provisions of the RERA are equally applicable to the Appellant and the 'Adjudicating Authority' under the RERA has jurisdiction to entertain 16  the complaints filed by the Respondents, being just, legal, correct and in tune and in consonance with the 'Objects and Reasons' of the RERA, no interference is warranted in the said orders.  24. In the light of these rival submissions, advanced by learned counsel for the parties and having regard to the factual aspects of the case and the provisions of the RERA, the three substantial questions of law are raised in these Second Appeals, on which the Appeals are admitted and the parties were heard finally at the stage of admission itself. Those questions can be stated as follows :-  (i) Whether the Appellate Tribunal has committed an error in holding that, the provisions of the RERA are applicable to the 'Agreement of Lease' executed between Appellant and Respondents?  (ii) Whether the Appellate Tribunal has committed an error in holding that, the 'Adjudicating Authority' under the RERA has jurisdiction to entertain the complaints filed by the Respondents, under Section 18 of RERA?  (iii) Whether the Adjudicating Authority, under the RERA, can go behind the 'Registration Certificate' of the Appellant, so as to hold that it has no jurisdiction, though the project is registered under the said Act? 17  Point No.1  25. In order to decide these substantial questions of law raised in these Second Appeals, it is necessary to consider in detail the provisions of the RERA, along with its 'Objects and Reasons'.  26. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, as its 'Preamble' shows, is enacted by the Legislature,  \"To establish the 'Real Estate Regulatory Authority' for regulation and promotion of the real estate sector and to ensure sale of plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, or sale of real estate project in an efficient and transparent manner and to protect the interest of consumers in the real estate sector and to establish an adjudicating mechanism for speedy redressal and also to establish the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal to hear Appeals from the decisions, directions or orders of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority and Adjudicating Officer and for the matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\"  27. The 'Statement of Objects and Reasons' of the Act shows that, the necessity of enacting such Act was realized by the Legislature after perceiving that,  The real estate sector plays a catalytic role in fulfilling the need and demand for housing and infrastructure in the country. While this sector has grown significantly in recent years, it has been largely unregulated, with 18  absence of professionalism and standardization and lack of adequate consumer protection.\"  28. It was felt that,  \"Though the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is available as a forum to the buyers in the real estate market, the recourse thereto is only curative and is not adequate to address all the concerns of buyers and promoters in that sector.\"  29. The lack of standardization was found to be a constraint to the healthy and orderly growth of real estate industry. In view of the above, it was found necessary to have a Central Legislation, namely, the RERA, in the interests of effective consumer protection, uniformity and standardization of business practices and transactions in the real estate sector.  30. The RERA is, therefore, enacted to provide for establishment of the 'Real Estate Regulation and Development Authority' for regulation and promotion of real estate sector and to ensure sale of plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in an efficient and transparent manner. The object of the RERA is stated to be to protect the interests of consumers in the real estate sector, like the Respondents herein.  31. Thus, the RERA is brought on Statute Book to ensure greater accountability towards the consumers and significantly reduce frauds 19  and delays, as also the current high transaction costs. It attempts to balance the interests of consumers and promoters, by imposing certain responsibilities on both. It seeks to establish symmetry of information between the promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions and set minimum standards of accountability and a fast track dispute resolution mechanism. The RERA, as stated in its 'Objects and Reasons', was enacted for inducting professionalism and standardization in the sector, thus, paving the way for accelerated growth and investments in the long run.  32. The RERA, therefore, imposes an obligation upon the promoter not to book, sell or offer for sale or invite persons to purchase any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project, without registering the real estate project with the Authority. It makes the registration of real estate project compulsory, in case where the area of land proposed to be developed exceed 500 sq.mtrs. or number of apartments proposed to be developed exceed 8, inclusive of all phases. It imposes an obligation upon the Real Estate Agent also not to facilitate sale or purchase of any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, without registering himself with the Authority. The Act imposes liability upon the Promoter to pay such compensation to the Allottees in the manner, as provided under RERA, in case if he fails to discharge any obligations imposed on him under RERA. 20  33. When the Constitutional validity of the RERA was challenged in the case of  ,   Bom. 9302, along with connected matters, by the various Developers and Promoters on the ground that, its provisions are discriminatory against them, the Division Bench of this Court was pleased to consider all the provisions of the RERA in their entirety and after having regard to its 'Objects and Reasons', held that,  \"The RERA law is not to be considered as anti- promoter. It is a law for regulation and development of the real estate sector. Under the scheme of the RERA, the promoter's interests are also safeguarded and there is a reason for the same. Unless a professional promoter making genuine efforts is not protected, then very purpose of development of real estate sector would be defeated.\"  34. The apprehensions, therefore, expressed on behalf of the Petitioners therein, namely, the Developers, in the said regard were held to be not well founded.  35. From the material placed on record during the course of the hearing, the Division Bench was pleased to observe its realisation that,  \"A very large number of people spread over various cities across the country have invested their hard- earned money in the real estate project for securing roof over their heads. For millions of people, a 21  dwelling house in this country is still a dream come true. The respective Governments, Corporations have declared beneficial schemes for low and high income groups for allotment of residential houses. However, that is not proving to be sufficient. The hard-earned money of the consumers, their life-time savings were invested in many such projects. It was found that many projects are lying idle for various reasons, due to which public at large, consumers of real estate sector are adversely affected financially and otherwise. A comprehensive law was the need of the day. The Parliament, therefore, thought it fit to comprehend under one umbrella regulatory mechanism for a disciplined growth of the real estate sector.\"  36. It was, thus, held that,  \"If the RERA is for the benefits of both the 'Allottees' and the 'Promoters', then there is no substance in the challenge to the Constitutional validity of the said Act.\"  37. Thus, it can be seen that, the enactment of the RERA is to meet the need of an hour. The need of the hour is to regulate this real estate industry and to ensure that some standardization and professionalism is brought into this real estate sector, which would help to protect not only the interests of the 'Allottees', the purchasers of the flats/the apartments, who have invested their hard-earned money to get the home of their dream, but also to protect the interests of the 'Promoters', 22  as without protecting their interests, the interests of the 'Allottees' or the 'Consumers' also cannot be safeguarded. The Act is enacted also to encourage the growth of the real estate industry, so that the common man's dream of a dwelling house can be fulfilled. The RERA is, therefore, essentially for regulation and healthy growth of the real estate sector.  38. The provisions of the Act are hence required to be construed and interpreted keeping in mind these 'Objects and Reasons' of the Act in the backdrop of the facts and reality on ground, which made it necessary to have some comprehensive law on the subject.  39. Section 2 of the Act gives definitions of the important terms used in the Act.  40. In the context of the 'Agreements of Lease', which are executed by the Appellant with the Respondents, in this case, the definitions of the terms \"Allottee\", as defined in Section 2(d) of the Act; \"Agreement for Sale\", as laid down in Section 2(c) of the Act, the word \"promoter\", as defined in Section 2(z) of the Act, and the term \"Real Estate Project\", as defined in Section 2(zn) of the Act, are very much relevant for understanding and interpreting the scope of the 'Agreements' entered into by the parties in this case. Hence, they are reproduced as follows :- 23  \"2(c). \"Agreement for Sale\" means an agreement entered into between the Promoter and the Allottee. 2(d). \"Allottee\", in relation to a real estate project, means the person to whom a plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, has been allotted, sold (whether as freehold or leasehold) or otherwise transferred by the Promoter, and includes the person who subsequently acquires the said allotment through sale, transfer or otherwise, but does not include a person to whom such plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, is given on rent.  2(zk). \"Promoter\" means :-  (i) a person who constructs or causes to be constructed an independent building or a building consisting of apartments, or converts an existing building or a part thereof into apartments, for the purpose of selling all or some of the apartments to other persons and includes his assignees; or  (ii) a person who develops land into a project, whether or not the person also constructs structures on any of the plots, for the purpose of selling to other persons all or some of the plots in the said project, whether with or without structures thereon; or  (iii) any development authority or any other public body in respect of allottees of -  (a) buildings or apartments, as the case may be, constructed by such authority or body 24  on lands owned by them or placed at their disposal by the Government; or  (b) plots owned by such authority or body or placed at their disposal by the Government,  for the purpose of selling all or some of the apartments or plots; or  (iv) an apex State level Co-operative Housing Finance Society and a primary Co-operative Housing Society, which constructs apartments or buildings for its Members or in respect of the allottees of such apartments or buildings; or  (v) any other person, who acts himself as a builder, coloniser, contractor, developer, estate developer or by any other name or claims to be acting as the holder of a power of attorney from the owner of the land on which the building or apartment is constructed or plot is developed for sale; or  (vi) such other person, who constructs any building or apartment for sale to the general public. 2(zn). \"Real Estate Project\" means the development of a building or a building consisting of apartments, or converting an existing building or a part thereof into apartments, or the development of land into plots or apartments, as the case may be, for the purpose of selling all or some of the said apartments or plots or building, as the case may be, and includes the common areas, the development works, all improvements and structures thereon, and all easement, rights and appurtenances belonging thereto.\" 25  41. The terms \"Apartment\" and \"Building\" are defined in Section 2(e) and 2(j) of the RERA Act, respectively, and they cover not only the residential property, but also the commercial property, such as offices, show rooms, shops or godowns. In that sense, the RERA has wide scope and coverage in the real estate projects.  42. In this context, vis-a-vis, these definitions given in the RERA, it would be essential to go through the 'Agreements' executed between the parties. No doubt, it is true, that the 'Agreements' are titled as 'Agreements of Lease'. The word \"Rent\" is also defined therein to mean 'the yearly rent amount payable by the customer to Lavasa, once the lease is actually granted in respect of the apartment'. The term 'Annual Rent' is defined to be Rs.1/- and the 'period of lease' is stated to be \"999 years\". Clause No.4(xi) of the 'Agreement' is relevant in that respect. It says that, 'under its Township Development Scheme, Lavasa proposes to construct 'Lake Views' on the 'Lots' identified by it and grant on lease, the apartments constructed therein for a period of 999 years on the notionally divided pieces of land termed as \"Lots\".'  43. Clause No.5.1 of the 'Agreement' further provides that, in consideration of the customer having expressly agreed to pay to Lavasa the lease premium, which is in the range of Rs.32 to 40 lakhs, as the case may be, and which is more than 80% of the total consideration amount 26  and the annual lease rent of Rs.1/- for the said apartment, Lavasa agrees to grant to the customer a lease for a period of 999 years for the said apartment.  44. Clause No.5.2 of the 'Agreement' provides that, the 'Lease Deed' was to be executed only after the development and construction of the said apartment has been fully completed and all the lease premium amounts are paid by the customer to Lavasa. The lease term was to commence from the date of execution of the registration of the 'Lease Deed' by Lavasa in respect of the said apartment in favour of the customer.  45. Clause No.6 of the 'Agreement' lays down the 'Schedule of the Payment', which shows that the payment was to be made as per the progress in the construction and except for some nominal amount, entire consideration was to be paid before possession was to be delivered. This clause is a typical clause, which is normally found in the 'Agreement of Sale' under MOFA. Clause No.9.1 states that, the possession of the apartment was to be handed over within a period of 24 months, on the customer depositing the entire lease premium installments.  46. Further clauses in the 'Agreement', like Clause No.10 pertaining to 27  'Common Amenities and Facilities'; Clause No.12.1 pertaining to 'Charges and Contributions towards the Maintenance and Amenities'; Clause No.13 relating to 'Statutory Payments' and even other clauses in the 'Agreement' are more or less the same like the ones which are necessarily found in the 'Agreement of Sale' executed under MOFA. As a matter of fact, though these Agreements are titled as 'Agreements of Lease', they are just the replicas of the 'Agreement of Sale', which is executed under the MOFA, except for the words 'lease' and 'rent' used therein.  47. Thus, if the entire 'Agreement' is perused as such, then it becomes apparent on the face of it also, that it cannot be termed or treated as an 'Agreement of Lease', but, in its real purport, it is an 'Agreement of Sale'. The very fact that more than 80% of the entire consideration amount is already paid by the Respondents to the Appellant and the lease premium agreed is only of Rs.1/- per annum, including the clause relating to the period of lease of 999 years, are self-speaking to prove that, in reality, the transaction entered into by the parties is an 'Agreement of Sale' and not an 'Agreement of Lease'; though it is titled as such. The law is well settled that the nomenclature of the document cannot be a true test of its real intent and the document has to be read as a whole to ascertain the intention of the parties. 28  48. Needless to state that, in an 'Agreement of Lease', the 'Lessee' does not pay more than 80% of the consideration amount towards the price of the said apartment. In an 'Agreement of Lease', the rent cannot be Rs.1/- per annum only, for such an apartment, market rate of which is more than Rs.40 lakhs. In an 'Agreement of Lease', parties do not pay the registration charges and stamp duty on the market value of the said apartment. The 'Agreement of Lease' also cannot be for such a long term for '999 years'. This long period of lease in itself is sufficient to hold that, it is not an 'Agreement of Lease', but, in reality, an 'Agreement of Sale'.  49. In this context, learned counsel for the Appellant has rightly placed reliance on the Judgment of the Madras High Court in the case of  , in Tax Case (Appeal) No.1031 of 2007; decided on 7 April 2014), wherein, reliance was placed on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of  , Nagpur and Bhandara, 1988 (172) ITR 311, holding that,  \"Having regard to the lease of plot for 99 years, it is clear that, under the lease in question, the Assessee has parted with an asset of an enduring nature, namely, the rights to possession and enjoyment of the properties leased for a period of 99 years, such transaction amounts to transfer of capital assets, as contemplated under Section 12B of the Income Tax Act, 1922.\" 29  50. Relying on this decision of the Apex Court in this Judgment, the Madras High Court has also held that, \"Having regard to the fact that the period of lease was of 99 years, it was as good as a lease in perpetuity or a permanent lease in as much as an alienation as a sale\". It was further held that, \"the mere use of the word 'lease' or the fact that a long term is fixed would not by itself make the document in lease. The payment of lumpsum amount also does not make it a permanent lease any the less an alienation than a sale\".  51. Here in the case, the period of lease being of '999 years'; it is as good as the transaction in perpetuity. The payment of entire consideration amount and the lease premium @ Rs.1/- per annum only, further make the intention clear that, it was not an 'Agreement of Lease', but, clearly an alienation, which can be called as 'sale'.  52. As to the contention of learned counsel for the Appellant that this Judgment of the Madras High Court pertains to the assessment under the Income Tax Act, in my considered opinion, even if it is so, the ratio laid down therein, which is pertaining to the legal aspects as to when the document titled as a 'lease' can be considered as an 'alienation by sale' is equally applicable to the facts of the present case also. 30  53. In this respect, this Court has also to consider the provisions of the RERA, which are required to be construed, having regard to its objects and reasons. When the very object of the RERA is to protect the consumers, the persons, who have invested their hard-earned money by entering into an 'Agreement', which is in the nature of purchase of the apartment itself, mere nomenclature of the document as 'Agreement of Lease' will not in any way take away the rights given to them by the statute.  54. Though much reliance is placed by learned counsel for the Appellant on the definition of the word \"Allottee\", as given in Section 2(d) of the RERA, to contend that the Allottee does not include a person to whom such plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, is \"given on rent\", it must be remembered that, the definition of the term 'Allottee' in the present context includes even when the plot sold is a \"freehold or leasehold\". To that extent, it has to be held that, the definition of 'Allottee' also includes the 'Lease Agreement', though it may not include such Agreement, when the apartment is in its real sense given purely on rent and it is, in reality, an 'Agreement of Rent and Lease' and not, in effect, a transaction of sale. The object of the RERA, it may be recalled, is to regulate the real estate industry, to ensure greater accountability towards consumers and significantly to reduce frauds and delays, to bring into it the standardization, professionalism and the transparency, 31  so that interests of the consumers are protected. In that view of the matter, the intention of the Legislature was to protect those persons like Respondents, who have invested substantial amounts in the real estate projects. Hence, they are required to be called as 'Consumers' or 'Allottees'. If they are excluded from the definition of 'Allottee' and thereby from the protection given under the Act, by giving restrictive meaning to the term 'Allottee', the very object of the Act would stand frustrated.  55. Here in the case, Respondents have already invested more than 80% of the consideration amount of the said apartment in the Real Estate Project of the Appellant. Their interests in the project undertaken by the Appellant are that of the 'Allottees', who have entered into such 'Agreements' for the purpose of purchase of the said flat/apartment. The object of the RERA cannot be to exclude such persons, who have invested huge amount in the Real Estate Project, may be under the 'Agreement of Lease' and taken such apartment on the lease of '999 years', which transaction is, in reality, the transaction of sale. 56. As rightly submitted by learned counsel for the Respondents, the definitions of the terms \"Allottee\", \"Promoter\" and \"Real Estate Project\"  are required to be construed harmoniously in the light of the 'Objects and Reasons' of the RERA. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of  , (1992) 1 SCC 335, 32  \"When the question arises as to the meaning of a certain provision in a statute, it is not only legitimate, but proper to read that provision in its context. The 'context' means, 'the statute as a whole, the previous state of the law, other statutes in pari materia, the general scope of the statute and the mischief, that it was intended to remedy.\"  57. It is a rule now firmly established that the intention of the Legislature must be found by reading the statute as a whole. Every clause of a statute has to be construed with reference to the context of the other clauses of the Act, to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute. An isolated consideration of the definitions may not give justice to the objects and reasons of the Act and the intention of the Legislature.  58. In this context, the 'Heydon's Rule of Suppression of Mischief' is required to be considered and highlighted. In Heydon's case ( ), it was held that,  \"For the sure and true interpretation of a statute in general (be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common law), four things are to be discerned and considered:  1 - What was the common law before the making of the Act ?  2 - What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide ? 33  3 - What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth, and  4 - The true reason of the remedy; and then the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro private commodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico.\"  59. Thus, what was the mischief, which is tried to be suppressed by enactment of this Act, needs to be considered. In respect of this enactment, the mischief was to ameliorate the sufferings of the persons, who have invested their hard-earned money in the real estate sector. The object of the RERA is to protect the 'Allottees' and simplify the remedying of the wrongs committed by the 'Promoter'. The RERA assures completion of project in time-bound manner. The main object is to ensure accountability on the part of the Real Estate Sector and to provide a comprehensive, effective and speedy remedy to the persons, who have invested large sums of money for having a home of their dreams. The very enactment of the Act was found necessary, because it was noticed that all over the country in large number of projects, the Allottees did not get possession for years together. Huge amount of money was found locked in. Hence, to suppress this mischief and to 34  provide effective remedy to the consumers, this law was enacted. One of the modes prescribed under the Act to regulate the Real Estate Sector was to impose some penalty on the Developer, who has failed to complete the project in stipulated time. The provisions of Section 18 of the Act are in that way compensatory in nature. As held by this Court in the case of Neelkamal Realtors Suburban Pvt. Ltd. (Supra),  \"When the 'Promoter' is, in effect, constructing the apartments for the 'Allottees' and the 'Allottees' make the payment of premium, the Act requires the 'Promoter' to pay interest to the 'Allottees', whose money it is, when the project is delayed beyond the contractual/agreed period. When the 'Allottee' has parted with entire consideration for purchase of the apartment and still he is not given possession and the 'Promoter' is enjoying the benefit of the said amount of consideration, it is expected under the Act that he is bound to pay compensation to the 'Allottee'. In other words, it becomes a case of unjust enrichment on the part of the 'Promoter', if he is not liable to compensate the 'Allottees' by paying interest on the amount retained by him, the 'Authority' under the RERA also can impose penalty or interest on the 'Allottees' for contravention of the obligations cast upon both of them, in view of Section 38 of the Act. Thus, the legislation has done balancing of rights and liabilities of 'Promoters' and 'Allottees'.\"  60. Now here in the facts of the present case, the Appellant has availed more than 80% of the consideration amount of the apartments booked 35  by the Respondents. Respondents had also paid registration charges and stamp-duty on the purchase price of the said apartments. Therefore, they are now entitled to get the benefits, which are given under the Act to such Allottees, as in that sense, they become the 'Allottees' of the apartments. Depriving them from enjoying the remedy available under Section 18 of the Act is as good as allowing the unjust enrichment on the part of the Appellant. That will defeat the object of the Legislature, with which this Act was enacted.  61. Once it is accepted that the Act was legislated to bring some discipline, professionalism, transparency and standardization in all the projects of real estate sector, then excluding from its scope the 'Agreements' like the ones, executed in the present case, is as good as frustrating the very object of the said Act. If the object of this Act is to ensure greater accountability towards consumer and reduce delays in completion of the real estate projects, then to hold that the agreements of the present nature, in which the Respondents have invested the substantial amount of consideration with an expectation of completion of the project within 24 months, as assured in the 'Agreements', is nothing but defeating the very purpose of the Act. Therefore, as held in Heydon's Rule, the interpretation of the statute has to be not only to suppress the mischief, but also to advance the remedy and also to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief. Interpretation 36  of the provisions should be such as it will add force and life to the cure and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act and not to defeat that intent.  62. The provisions of any statute for that matter, as held by the Apex Court in the case of  , (2000) 5 SCC 346, are required to be considered in their practical application, as to how they will achieve the object of the Act. In this Judgment, the Hon'ble Apex Court has very lucidly and effectively held that;  \"15. 'Statutes', it is often said, should be construed not as theorems of Euclid, but with some imagination of the purposes, which lie behind them, and to be too literal in the meaning of words is to see the skin and miss the soul. The method suggested for adoption, in cases of doubt as to the meaning of the words used, is to explore the intention of the Legislature through the words, the context, which gives the colour, the context, the subject-matter, the effects and consequences or the spirit and reason of the law. The general words and collocation or phrases, howsoever wide or comprehensive in their literal sense, are interpreted from the context and scheme underlying in the text of the Act. The decision in  , (1987) 3 SCC 279, case also emphasizes the need to construe the words in a provision in the context of the scheme underlying the other provisions of the Act as well, which ultimately was considered to be in tune with the object set out in the 'Statement of the Objects and Reasons' and in the 37  'Preamble'. Apart from the fact that the observations contained in the decision have to be understood in the light of the issue raised and exercise undertaken by the Court therein, the fallacy in the submission on behalf of the Appellant lies, though not in the principles of construction to be adopted, but in the assumption of the counsel to confine or restrict and construe the law in question to be one made to regulate the trade of sawing, contrary to the very 'Preamble', which reads,  \"to make provisions for regulating in the public interest the establishment and operation of saw-mills and saw-pits and trade of sawing for the protection and conservation of forest and the environment\".\"  63. It needs to be emphasized that, the too literal meaning of the words given in the Statute is to not understand the scheme underlying the provisions of the Act. The intention of the Legislature has to be gathered not only from the terms used, but also from the 'Objects and Reasons' and 'Preamble' to the said legislation. Here in the case, the very 'object' of this comprehensive legislation is to ensure that, the consumers do not suffer, by whichever name or nomenclature they are called or under whichever document, they entered into an 'Agreement'. In the very 'Objects and Reasons' of the Act, it was clearly stated that, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, is though available as a forum to the 'Buyers' in the real estate market, the recourse is only curative and is not adequate to 38  address all the concerns of the 'Buyers' and 'Promoters' in that sector. Hence, it was found that, for this lack of adequate consumer protection, which, to some extent, was given by the specific statute, like MOFA, being not available in other statutes and to all the consumers to protect their interests effectively, this Act was enacted. Now allowing the Respondents to remain out of the purview of this Act, merely because their 'Agreements' are titled as 'Agreement of Lease', will not give justice to the provisions of this Act also.  64. Another object of the Act was also to bring under the umbrella of 'Adjudicating Authority' all the disputes between the Buyers on the one hand and the Promoters, Developers and Development Authorities on the other hand in respect of the Real Estate Projects undertaken by them. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of Neelkamal Realtors (Supra) has considered this adequate mechanism provided under the Act for balancing rights of 'Allottees' and 'Promoters', by observing in paragraph No.124, as follows :-  \"The entire scheme of the RERA is required to be kept in mind. It is already submitted during the course of hearing that, in many cases, helpless Allottees had approached Consumer Forum, High Courts, Apex Court in a given fact situation of the case. The Courts have been passing orders by moulding reliefs by granting interest, compensation to the Allottees and issuing directions for timely completion of project, transit accommodation during completion of 39  project, so on and so forth. Under the RERA, now this function is assigned to the Authority, Tribunal. An Appeal lies to the High Court. Under one umbrella, under on regulation and one law, all the issues are tried to be resolved.\"  65. Thus, it can be seen that the object of establishing this 'adjudicating mechanism' was to provide for speedy dispute redressal by bringing all the disputes under one umbrella. This 'redressal mechanism' is to ensure that, the consumers like the Respondents, who have invested their large amount of hard-earned money in the real estate projects, should get its returns at the earliest, either in the form of completion of the projects and possession of the apartments, or, by way of compensation with interests. If the Respondents, who have invested such money, are not allowed to approach this 'Adjudicating Authority', established under the RERA, and the 'Adjudicating Authority' merely holds that, as the 'Agreement' is titled as an 'Agreement of Lease', it has no jurisdiction to entertain their grievances raised under Section 18 of the said Act, then such interpretation cannot be in consonance and in tune with the object of the Act.  66. The Appellate Tribunal has, therefore, rightly held that, if one has to adopt the object-oriented approach, then without even doing violations to the plain language used in the statute, such approach can be adopted in the instant case, keeping in mind the principle that 40  legislative futility is to be avoided, so long as interpretative possibility permits. These are the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of   and Co.,  , quoted with approval in the case of  , (2009) 15 SCC 275;  \"19. The Courts, while interpreting the provisions of any Act, should, no doubt, adopt an object-oriented approach, keeping in mind the principle that, legislative futility is to be avoided so long as interpretative possibility permits. But, at the same time, the Courts will have to keep in mind that, the object-oriented approach cannot be carried to the extent of doing violence to the plain language used in the statute, by re- writing the words of a statute in place of the actual words used, or, by ignoring definite words used in the statute.\"  67. Here in the case, as regards the word \"Allottee\", as a matter of fact, it can never be the intention of the Legislature to exclude long term leases from the purview of the Act; otherwise, the Legislature would not have used the words 'freehold' or 'leasehold', when it has defined the term 'Allottee', under Section 2(d) of the Act.  68. Moreover, exclusion of such long term lease from the purview of the Act would be defeating the very object of the Act. The Developer- Promoter may, in such cases, by executing the 'Agreement' with the 41  nomenclature as the 'Agreement of Lease', can very conveniently escape from the clutches of the provisions of this Act. When the Legislature has stated in the definition of the term 'Allottee' that it does not include the person, to whom the plot, apartment or building is \"given on rent\", the intention of the Legislature was only to exclude pure 'Agreements of Lease' or the 'rent', as the Lessees therein have not invested the substantial amount, like purchase price, of the apartment in completion of the project. One may also include therein licenses, but one cannot exclude the persons, who have invested more than 80% of the purchase price of the apartment. One also cannot exclude the transactions, in which the apartment was to be built and then the possession thereof was to be handed over on payment of the entire consideration amount at the market rate. Such 'Agreements' can in no way be called as 'Agreements of Lease' at all. The intention of the Legislature, which is found reflected in the 'Objects and Reasons' of the Act and its various provisions, makes it abundantly clear that, to all the projects, wherein the possession of the apartments is to be handed over in consideration of the sale price or the market price, such projects are included under the purview of this Act. It has to be held that, the Legislature would have never intended to exclude the persons like the Respondents, who have invested their hard- earned money in such projects, from the protective and beneficial provisions of this Act. 42  69. As held by this Court in the case of Neelkamal Realtors Suburban Pvt. Ltd. (Supra),  \"The provisions like Section 4(2)(l)(D) of RERA, which contemplates that, 'promoter' should deposit 70% of the amounts realized for the real estate project from the 'Allottees' in a separate account, which means that 30% of the amounts realized by the 'Promoter' from the 'Allottees' will be retained by him and in such case, if the 'Promoter' defaults to handover possession to the 'Allottees' in the agreed time-limit or the extended one, then the 'Allottees' shall reasonably expect such compensation from the 'Promoter' till the handing over of the possession, are necessarily incorporated; because, it was noticed by the 'Select Committee' and the 'Standing Committee' of the 'Parliament' that, huge sums of money collected from the 'Allottees' were not utilized fully in the projects, or, the amounts collected from the 'Allottees' were diverted to other sectors, than the concerned project.\"  70. Here in the case also, the consideration amount for the apartments agreed to be handed over to the Respondents is already obtained by the Appellant. As per the 'Agreement', the possession of the apartments was to be delivered within 24 months from that date; however, even after the lapse of 7 years, the Respondents have not received the possession; thereby indicating default on the part of the Appellant in fulfilling his obligations. If such 'Allottees', like the Respondents herein, cannot be 43  kept out of the purview of the Act, which is clearly enacted with express intent to ensure that, they get the succor. At the cost of repetition, it has to be stated that, the mischief, to suppress which, the Act was enacted, was that there was no law regulating the real estate sector development work and obligations of 'Promoters' and 'Allottees'. This need was felt by the 'Parliament', because, it was noticed that, all over the country, in large number of projects, the 'Allottees' did not get possession for years together and huge sums of money of the 'Allottees' was locked in such projects. Hence, if, in the similar situation and fact, the funds of the Respondents are locked in the development projects of the Appellant, they cannot be deprived from the benefit of this Act, merely on the count that the 'Agreements' executed by them with the Appellant are titled as 'Agreement to Lease' and not 'Agreement of Sale'.  71. Here the Hayden's Rule of Suppression of Mischief needs to be applied with full force and if that Rule is applied, then the provisions of the RERA are required to be held as equally applicable to the long term leases, like the present one of \"999 years\"; or, where the substantial amount of consideration is already obtained by the 'Developer'. Then the definitions of the terms 'Allottee', or, 'Real Estate Project', or, even that of 'Promoter', are required to be interpreted in that context and not in isolation, by placing reliance simplicitor on the word 'selling' used in these three definitions. As rightly submitted by learned counsel for the 44  Respondents, the word 'selling' is grammatical variation of the word \"sold\", used in section 2(d) of the Act in the definition of the term \"Allottee\". If the allotment of a plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, can be whether as a freehold or as leasehold, then the word 'selling' used in the definitions of 'Promoter' and 'Real Estate Project' also includes the allotment of a plot by lease. Merely because the Legislature has excluded the allotment, when it is given on rent, it does not exclude the long term lease like the present one. That will be defeating and frustrating the object of the Act and hence, it has to be held that the Appellate Tribunal has rightly held that, so far as the present case is concerned, considering the long term lease of '999 years', it would definitely amount to sale.  Point Nos.2 and 3  72. In the facts of the present case, there is one more reason to hold that Respondents' complaints filed under Section 18 of the Act are maintainable before the 'Adjudicating Authority'. It is because the Appellant itself has registered this project under the RERA and accepted its liabilities under the Act.  73. Section 3 of the RERA in this respect is assuming significance and it can be reproduced as follows :- 45 Section 3 : \"Prior registration of Real Estate Project with Real Estate Regulatory Authority\"  (1) No Promoter shall advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale, or invite persons to purchase in any manner any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any Real Estate Project or part of it, in any planning area, without registering the Real Estate Project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority established under this Act:  Provided that, projects that are on-going on the date of commencement of this Act and for which the Completion Certificate has not been issued, the Promoter shall make an application to the Authority for registration of the said project within a period of three months from the date of commencement of this Act:  Provided further that, if the Authority thinks necessary, in the interest of Allottees, for projects, which are developed beyond the planning area but with the requisite permission of the local authority, it may, by order, direct the Promoter of such project to register with the Authority, and the provisions of this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder, shall apply to such projects from that stage of registration.  (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no registration of the Real Estate Project shall be required-  (a) where the area of land proposed to be developed does not exceed five hundred square meters or the number of apartments proposed to be developed does not exceed eight inclusive of all phases:  Provided that, if the appropriate Government considers it necessary, it may, reduce the threshold 46  below five hundred square meters or eight apartments, as the case may be, inclusive of all phases, for exemption from registration under this Act;  (b) where the Promoter has received Completion Certificate for a Real Estate Project prior to commencement of this Act;  (c) for the purpose of renovation or repair or re- development, which does not involve marketing, advertising, selling or new allotment of any apartment, plot or building, as the case may be, under the Real Estate Project.  Explanation - For the purpose of this Section, where the Real Estate Project is to be developed in phases, every such phase shall be considered a stand alone Real Estate Project, and the Promoter shall obtain registration under this Act for each phase separately.\"  74. This Section thus makes registration of the project mandatory for its sale. As per Clause (2) of Section 3, the RERA is made applicable even to the projects that are on-going on the date of commencement of the RERA and for which, Completion Certificate has not been issued. In respect of such projects also, Promoters are required to register the projects with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority within three months from the commencement of the RERA, with an option that they can register entire real estate project or part of it. The specific 'Explanation' to the Section 3 of the RERA provides that, where the real estate project 47  is to be developed in phases, every such phase shall be considered as a stand alone real estate project and the Promoter shall obtain registration under this Act for each phase separately. This 'Explanation' is important for the purpose of the present litigation, as here in the case, the Appellant has already got itself registered under RERA, by making an application under Section 4 of the said Act. The 'Registration Certificate' is produced on record proving that, the entire project as such is registered and not only certain components thereof. It is not the case of the Appellant also that only some parts of the components of the said project are registered. Though it is contended that, the RERA is applicable only to some part of the project, despite that, the entire project is registered under the RERA, as is evident from the 'Registration Certificate'.  75. Hence, there is definitely some substance in the submission advanced by learned counsel for the Respondents that, if the Appellant has registered itself under the RERA, it follows that Appellant has submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the RERA. Now Appellant cannot contend that the provisions of Section 18 of the RERA are not applicable to it, as the 'Agreements' executed with the Respondents are 'Agreements of Lease' and not an 'Agreement of Sale'. As rightly submitted by learned counsel for the Respondents, by registering itself under the RERA and availing the benefits, which were available under 48  the RERA, now Appellant cannot approbate and reprobate by contending that, the said provisions are applicable only to a particular aspect and not to the complaints, which are filed by the Respondents and that too merely on the count that, the 'Agreements' executed with the Respondents are the 'Agreements of Lease' and not 'Agreement of Sale'. By volunteering to register itself under the RERA, Appellant has surrendered itself to the jurisdiction of the Adjudicating Authority, established under the RERA. The option was available to the Appellant to register only part of the project and not the entire or part of the project, in respect of which the 'Agreements of Lease' are executed. The Appellant had not exercised that option. Without any qualification or reservation, Appellant has registered the entire project with RERA. Appellant cannot, therefore, contend that, the Adjudicating Authority established under the RERA has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaints filed by the Respondents-Allottees under Section 18 of the said Act. The provisions of the RERA cannot be bifurcated in the sense that, only in respect of certain aspects, the Appellant can avail benefit of the said Act; by registering itself and as per its convenience, whenever Appellant has to comply with the obligations therein, it can raise contention that the provisions of the RERA are not applicable, because it is an 'Agreement of Lease'. The provisions of Section 115 of the Evidence Act definitely prevents, precludes and estopps the Appellant from doing so. 49  76. Moreover, if the Appellant is permitted to raise such defence, it would be as good as allowing the 'Adjudicating Authority', established under the RERA, to go behind the Registration Certificate for holding that the said registration under RERA is not applicable to the project of the Appellant. Can the Adjudicating Authority do so? The answer has to be in the negative, if the scheme of the RERA is considered. It is pertinent to note that, under the RERA, there are two different Authorities established; one is Real Estate Regulatory Authority, which is defined under Section 2(1) and established under Section 20 of the RERA. It is conferred with the jurisdiction to entertain the application for registration of the projects. As can be seen from the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the RERA, application for registration of real estate project is to be made to this Real Estate Regulatory Authority, established under Section 20 of the said Act. Chapter 'V' of the RERA deals with the 'Establishment and Incorporation of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority'. Section 21 thereof deals with 'Composition of the said Authority' and Section 22 thereof deals with 'Qualification of Chairperson and Members of the Authority'. It is for this Authority to consider whether to grant registration or not and in case of breach of terms and conditions on the part of the Promoter, whether to revoke the said registration under Section 7 of the Act. The Rules framed under the RERA are more than sufficient to that effect. 50  77. As against it, the Adjudicating Authority under the RERA is defined in Section 2(a) as the 'Adjudicating Officer' appointed under sub- section (1) of Section 71. This 'Adjudicating Authority', as can be seen from Section 71(1) of the Act, is established for the purpose of adjudging the compensation under Sections 12, 14, 18 and 19 of the said Act. Section 31 provides that, the complaints are to be filed by the aggrieved persons under the RERA with the 'Adjudicating Authority' for any violation or contravention of the provisions of this Act.  78. Therefore, the 'Authority', which grants registration under RERA, is different than the 'Authority', which is established to adjudicate the grievances of the aggrieved persons under the said Act. One Authority cannot encroach on the jurisdiction exercised or to be exercised by the another Authority. Here in the case, the 'Registration Certificate' to the Appellant is granted by the Regulatory Authority, established under Section 20 of the said Act and now the Appellant is calling upon the 'Adjudicating Authority', established under Section 71 of the RERA, to go behind that 'Registration Certificate' and to hold that the provisions of RERA are not applicable to the Appellant.  79. In my considered opinion, this course is not permissible under the law to challenge the Registration Certificate issued by one 'Authority' before the another 'Authority' and calling upon that 'Authority' not to 51  consider such 'Certificate of Registration' and then to hold that the RERA is not applicable to the said project. Once there is registration under the RERA, then it follows that, all the provisions of the RERA become applicable to such project, unless some phases are specifically excluded from registration. It also becomes applicable to the persons, who have invested in the said real estate project. It is applicable both, to the Appellant and also to the Respondents. The Appellant, after having taken the advantage of registration under the RERA, cannot turn back and say that the provisions of the RERA are not applicable to the complaints made by the Respondents in respect of the very same project.  80. As submitted by learned counsel for the Appellant, it may be true that, the registration alone cannot be a test to decide whether the provisions of the RERA are applicable or not; because, in that case, if the project is not registered, then, it will not be possible to accept that the provisions of the RERA are not applicable to such projects. However, in my considered opinion, this reasoning or logic cannot be applicable to the instant case, as Section 3 of the RERA mandates registration. It clearly provides that, no promoter shall even advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale or invite persons to purchase, in any manner, any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project or part of it, in any planning area, without registering the real estate 52  project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority established under the RERA. Even in respect of ongoing projects also, this mandate applies, unless it is shown that, 'Completion Certificate' has been already issued. The word used in Section 3(1) and the Proviso to Section 3 in respect of 'ongoing project' is \"shall\", thereby making the intention of the legislature clear that, in respect of those ongoing projects also, the registration has to be sought within a period of three months from the date of commencement of the Act. Sub-clause (2) of Section 3 provides for some exceptions, where registration of real estate project shall not be required and those exceptions are pertaining to the projects, where the area of land proposed to be developed does not exceed 500 sq.mtrs., or, the number of apartments proposed to be developed does not exceed 8, inclusive of all phases, or, where the Promoter has received Completion Certificate prior to commencement of the Act. One more exception laid down in Clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 3 is that, when the project undertaken is for the purpose of renovation or repair or re- development, which does not involve marketing, advertising, selling or new allotment of any apartment, plot or building, as the case may be; otherwise, for all other Development Projects, the registration under the RERA is mandatory.  81. The Appellant had, therefore, no choice but to get their project registered under the RERA, considering that it was for development of 53  the plot, exceeding the area of more than 500 sq.mtrs. and it was for the number of apartments exceeding 8, inclusive of all phases. The Appellant's project is also not completed; at-least, as no Completion Certificate is obtained and, therefore, it is an on-going project. Thus, when the Registration Certificate for such real estate project was compulsory, in order to book, sell or offer for sale the plots or apartments constructed therein, and it was obtained accordingly, then Appellant can no more contend that such Registration Certificate will not be applicable for the construction of the apartments in the said project and to the Allottees, who have entered into 'Agreements' in respect of the said apartments.  82. It is pertinent to note that, if, according to the Appellant also, the project undertaken was not of \"development\" and \"sale of the apartments\" constructed therein, then the Appellant was not bound to register the same and would not have registered the same, under Section 3 of the RERA. If the Appellant has also understood the 'Agreements' executed with the Respondents as only 'Agreements of Lease', then Appellant could have very well avoided the registration under the RERA; because, in that case, Appellant could have contended that, it is not bound by Section 3 of the RERA, as the project was not undertaken for \"sale of the flats\" or the apartments, but only for the purpose of giving the apartments \"on rent\". The very fact that the Appellant has got itself 54  registered under the RERA makes it necessary to infer that, the Appellant was very well aware that this project was for sale of the apartments constructed in the project and that is why, it was bound by the provisions of the RERA.  83. Moreover, here there is no question of applying the logic that, if the project is not registered, whether the RERA will not be applicable, even if it is otherwise proved to be a project of development, because, as per the mandate of the RERA, all the real estate projects are now required to be registered, if the apartments therein are constructed for the purpose of sale or otherwise. The fact that the Appellant has, therefore, registered the project also makes it necessary to infer that, the Appellant has invited upon itself the applicability of the provisions of the RERA, as Appellant is also fully aware that whatever 'Agreements' executed by it with the Respondents are in the nature of sale, though they are titled as 'Agreements of Lease'.  84. Thus, having regard to the totality of the facts and circumstances and the terms and conditions of the 'Agreements', having regard to the entire purport and object of the Act, it has to be held that, the dispute in the present case definitely falls within the jurisdiction of RERA. The interplay of all the provisions contained in the Act, coupled with the real purport of the 'Agreement of Lease', leads to no other inference, but to 55  hold that, the complaints filed by the Respondents before the 'Adjudicating Officer', under Section 18 of the Act, are definitely maintainable and the 'Adjudicating Officer' is having the jurisdiction to entertain and decide those complaints. The mechanical interpretation given by the 'Adjudicating Officer' to the provisions of the Act, merely focusing on the nomenclature of the 'Agreement', was clearly defeating the object of the Act and hence, it was rightly set aside by the Appellate Tribunal.  85. These Second Appeals, therefore, hold no merits; hence, stand dismissed.  86. In view thereof, the Civil Applications pending therein do not survive and the same are disposed of as infructuous. [DR.

Heard finally, at the stage of admission itself, with the consent of learned counsel for the Appellant and Respondents.  2. Admit.  3. These three Appeals are preferred, under Section 58 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, (for short, \"RERA\"), by Lavasa Corporation, which is developing a Township Project to construct 'Lake Views' and which is registered under the RERA.  4. These Appeals are raising the common questions of law as to 'whether the provisions of the RERA would apply in case of an 'Agreement to Lease'?'; particularly in the facts of the present case, 'whether the definition of the term\"Promoter\", as provided under 3  Section 2(zk) in the RERA, would include a 'Lessor', and 'whether the remedy provided to the 'Allottees' under Section 18 of the RERA can be available only against the 'Promoter', or, in that sense, also against a 'Lessor'?'  5. The Appellants are aggrieved by the three separate orders passed by the Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal in three separate Appeals filed by the Respondents, under Section 43(5) of the RERA, against the orders passed by the 'Adjudicating Authority', under Section 18 of the said Act. By the impugned orders, the Appellate Tribunal has set aside the orders passed by the 'Adjudicating Authority' and held that, the provisions of the RERA are applicable even in case of 'Agreement of Lease' in the present case and, therefore, the Adjudicating Member of the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority has jurisdiction to entertain the complaints filed by the Respondents. It was held so, despite the fact that, according to the Appellant, relationship between the Appellant and Respondents is of 'Lessor' and 'Lessee' and there is no sale and/or absolute transfer of right, title and interest in favour of the Respondents with respect to their respective apartments.  6. The factual matrix of the case, in which these questions are raised, can be depicted as follows :-  Respondents claim themselves to be the bonafide purchasers of 4  their respective apartments in the projects/buildings known as \"Brook View\", which is being constructed at Village Dasve, Taluka Mulshi; \"Belshore\", which is being constructed at Bhugaon Taluka; and \"Lake View\", which is being constructed at Mulshi Taluka, respectively, in Pune District by the Appellant herein. In pursuance of the negotiations between the parties, the 'Agreements of Lease' came to be executed between them on various dates in the years 2014, 2013 and 2010, respectively. As per the said 'Agreements', the Respondents have booked the apartments on the basis of lease for the period of 999 years in the Township Scheme of the Appellant. They had paid most of the consideration amount, which is, approximately, to the extent of 80% of the sale price. They have also paid substantial amount towards the stamp-duty and the registration charges.  7. As per the 'Agreements of Lease' executed between the parties, the project was to be completed and the possession of the apartments was to be handed over to the Respondents within a period of 24 months. After waiting bonafidely for all these six to seven years for getting the project completed and after making several enquiries with the Appellant about the progress of the said project, the Respondents found that there are no chances of the project being completed in a near future. Hence, after the Appellant registered itself with the RERA, Respondents approached the 'Adjudicating Authority' under the MahaRERA with an application, 5  under Section 18 of the RERA, for compensation with interest for every month of the delay in handing over possession of the apartments and for various other reliefs, to which they are entitled under the RERA.  8. Appellant, however, on its appearance before the Adjudicating Authority, challenged the very applicability of the provisions of the RERA to the 'Agreements of Lease' entered into by the parties contending inter alia that, the Respondents are the 'Lessees', as the 'Agreements' entered into between the parties are clearly the 'Agreements of Lease' and not an 'Agreement of Sale'. Therefore, such 'Agreements of Lease' being specifically excluded from the ambit of the RERA, the Adjudicating Authority under the RERA has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaints.  9. After perusing the complaints, 'Agreements of Lease' and the provisions of RERA, the Adjudicating Authority was pleased to hold that, as the definition of the 'Allottee', as given in Section 2(d) of the RERA, does not include a person, to whom such plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, is given \"on rent\"; and as the definition of the 'Promoter', as given in Section 2(zk) of the RERA, includes only the person, who has constructed or caused to be constructed a building or apartment for the \"purpose of selling\" and thereby excluding from its purview the \"purpose of lease\" and in this case, as admittedly, the 6  'Agreements' executed by the Appellant with the Respondents are the 'Agreements of Lease', such 'Agreements' cannot fall within the purview of the provisions of RERA. Hence, as the remedy under Section 18 of the RERA is available only, against the Promoter's failure, under Section 31 of the said Act, which confers jurisdiction on the Adjudicating Authority, only when there is violation or contravention of the provisions of the RERA or the Rules and Regulations made thereunder, it was held that, the MahaRERA has no jurisdiction to entertain the present complaints or the dispute and, accordingly, dismissed the complaints for want of jurisdiction.  10. When Respondents challenged this order of the Adjudicating Authority before the Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, the Appellate Authority, however, after perusal of the 'Agreement of Lease' as a whole and after considering the object and purpose of the RERA, was pleased to hold that, though the 'Agreements' between the parties are titled as 'Lease Agreements', in effect, they are the agreements of \"absolute sale\" and, therefore, the provisions of the RERA will be applicable. The Appellate Tribunal also held that, the Appellant has got itself registered under the provisions of the RERA and, therefore, now it is precluded or estopped from contending that the provisions of the RERA are not applicable thereto. In this respect, the Appellate Tribunal has relied upon the 'Principle of Estoppel', laid down in Section 115 of the 7  Evidence Act and, thus, allowed the Appeals and held that the 'Adjudicating Officer' of MahaRERA has jurisdiction to entertain the complaints on its merits. The matters were, therefore, directed to be placed before the 'Adjudicating Officer' of MahaRERA, to be decided in accordance with law.  11. While challenging these orders of the Appellate Tribunal, the submission of learned counsel for the Appellant is that, the impugned orders are clearly against the express provisions of the RERA and hence, they cannot be sustainable in law. To substantiate this submission, learned counsel for the Appellant has taken this Court initially through various clauses in the 'Agreements of Lease', including the title thereof, to submit that, such 'Agreements' in no way can be called as 'Agreements of Sale'. It is submitted by him that, the parties had entered into the 'Agreements of Lease', knowing fully well that those were the 'Agreements' to book the apartment \"on lease for 999 years\" in the project of the Appellant. The definitions given in the 'Agreements of Lease' also clearly indicate and prove that it was purely a transaction of lease and not of sale. It is submitted that, the 'Agreements' nowhere use the terms 'sale', 'sale-consideration' or 'purchase price', but, the 'lease' and 'rent'. The term 'Rent' is defined to mean, 'the yearly rent amount payable by the customer to the Appellant-Lavasa, once the lease is actually granted in respect of the apartment'. As per Clause No.5.1 of the 8  Agreement, the \"Annual Lease Rent\" is fixed at Rs.1/- only, for the said apartment. Clause No.7 defines the \"Rent\" as \"yearly rent\" of Rs.1/- for the lease of the said apartment'. Clause No.9.1 of the Agreement also states that, possession was to be given, subject to the Respondents making timely payment of the deposit amount against the \"lease premium\" installments for the ultimate \"grant of lease\" of the said apartment.  12. Thus, it is submitted that, the reading of the 'Agreement' in its entirety is more than sufficient to prove that, it was an 'Agreement of Lease' and in no way an 'Agreement of Sale', so as to attract the provisions of the RERA. It is submitted that, even the Respondents themselves are aware that it is an 'Agreement of Lease' and in their complaints filed before the MahaRERA, they have stated in paragraph No.4(A)-1 that, it was an 'Agreement of Lease' and they are the genuine and bonafide 'Lessees' in respect of the apartments. They have further stated in paragraph No.3 of the complaint that, they had agreed to book an apartment \"on lease for 999 years\". In paragraph No.5 of the complaint, they have further stated that, it was an 'Agreement of Lease' of apartment with the Appellant for booking of the said apartment. In paragraph No.9 thereof, they had further stated that, they had called upon the Appellant to comply with the 'Agreement for Lease' of apartment, as mandated in law. Thus, it is submitted that, when as per 9  the own case of the Respondents, they had entered into 'Agreements of Lease' with the Appellant and now also, they are seeking compliance of the said 'Agreements of Lease', the question of attracting the provisions of the RERA does not arise in the present case.  13. In this respect, learned counsel for the Appellant has also relied upon the definition of the term 'Promoter', as given in Section 2(zk) of the RERA, which contemplates a person, who constructs or caused to be constructed an apartment \"for the purpose of selling\". It is urged that, the very definition of the term 'Allottee', as given in Section 2(d) of the RERA, specifically provides that, Allottee does not include a person to whom such plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, \"is given on rent\". Even the definition of the term 'Real Estate Project', as given in Section 2(zn) of RERA, means the development of a building or a building consisting of apartments for the \"purpose of selling\" all or some of the said apartments. Hence, it follows that, the Legislature has made its intention very clear of excluding from the purview of the provisions of the RERA an 'Agreement of Lease' or the case where the premises are given on rent.  14. Here in the case, it is, therefore, submitted that the remedy under Section 18 of the RERA, which is available only against a \"Promoter\", cannot be available against the Appellant, who is not the \"Promoter\" and 10  when the Respondents are not the \"Purchasers\" or the \"Allottees\", but the \"Lessees\". According to him, even combined reading of Sections 18 and 31 of the RERA, which provide for filing of complaints under Section 18 of the said Act to the Adjudicating Officer, makes it clear that the Adjudicating Officer can entertain such complaint, only if the complaint is filed under Section 18 of the RERA. Here in the case, as the complaint does not come within the parameters of Section 18 of the RERA, the Respondents not being the 'Allottees', nor the Appellant is the 'Promoter', nor it is a 'Real Estate Project', undertaken for the purpose of \"selling\" of the apartments, the 'Adjudicating Officer' had rightly held that, it has no jurisdiction to entertain such complaints filed by the Respondents.  15. It is urged that, the Appellate Tribunal has, however, misconstrued the provisions of the RERA, misread the contents of the 'Agreement of Lease' and thereby violated the provisions of the RERA by expanding its scope. It is submitted that, the legislative intent was very clear of not to apply the provisions of the RERA to the 'Agreement of Lease'. However, the Appellate Authority has gone beyond the legislative intent and interpreted the provisions of the RERA to include even the 'Agreement of Lease'. Hence, according to learned counsel for the Appellant, the impugned orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal call for interference in these Second Appeals.  16. Secondly, it is submitted that, the Appellate Authority has 11  committed an error in invoking the 'Principle of Estoppel', as laid down in Section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. It is urged that, the project undertaken by the Appellant in the name of \"Lavasa\" is a very huge and large project and the registration of the project is sought only in respect of some of its components. Moreover, registration of the project under the RERA cannot be a sole test to invoke the provisions of the said Act. According to learned counsel for the Appellant, if registration under the RERA can be the sole test for applying the provisions of the said Act, then, applying the same logic, the RERA will not be made applicable to the projects, which are not registered. That cannot be the intention of the Legislature. Therefore, according to him, merely because the Appellant has sought registration under the RERA, it is not precluded or estopped from raising the contention that, as the 'Agreements' executed with the Respondents are that of 'Agreements of Lease' and the status of the Respondents is only of a 'Lessee' and not that of a 'Purchaser', their complaints cannot be entertained under the RERA. It is submitted that, as those complaints are clearly under Section 18 of the RERA and to these Respondents, therefore, RERA cannot be made applicable and hence, the Adjudicating Authority, under Section 31 of RERA, has no jurisdiction to entertain those complaints. According to learned counsel for the Appellant, on this score also, the Appellate Tribunal has committed an error in law, which is required to be rectified in these Second Appeals. 12  17. Per contra, learned counsel for the Respondents has taken this Court through the 'Objects and Reasons' of the RERA and also its various provisions to advance his submission that, it is applicable wherever the project is undertaken for development of the property and for handing over possession of the apartment, after its development, on payment of consideration amount. Here in the case, it is submitted that, the 'Agreement of Lease' is to be read as a whole to understand its real purport and object. According to him, the various clauses in the 'Agreement'; especially the clause relating to the period of lease and also the payment of consideration amount, clearly go to prove that the 'Agreement' was for long term duration of lease, to the extent of 999 years; thereby clearly indicating that, it was an 'Agreement of Sale' and not an 'Agreement of Lease', though it was titled as such. In his submission, mere title or nomenclature of 'Agreement' cannot determine its real nature. Here in the case, it is urged that, more than 80% of the consideration amount is already paid to the Appellant. Even the stamp- duty and the registration charges are paid on the purchase price of the apartments. Therefore, in the real sense, it is an 'Agreement of Sale'.  18. It is further submitted by learned counsel for the Respondents that, the definition of the term \"Allottee\", as given in Section 2(d) of the RERA, in relation to a real estate project means, a person to whom a plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, has been allotted, sold 13  (whether as freehold or leasehold) or \"otherwise transferred\" by the Promoter. Thus, it is submitted that, this definition includes not only the freehold plots, but also the leasehold plots. It is urged that, the definitions of the terms 'Promoter' and 'Real Estate Project', as given in Sections 2(zk) and 2(zn) of the RERA, are also required to be read in that context, as they clearly makes the intention of the Legislature clear that the Legislature not only wanted the sale to be included, but also any other transaction relating to leasehold.  19. In this case, according to learned counsel for the Respondents, in the real sense, the apartment is not only \"allotted\", but \"sold\" to the Respondents, though the 'Agreement' may have been titled as that of a lease. Moreover, it is urged that, the terms of the 'Agreement' make it clear that, the 'Lease-Deed' is yet to be executed. The rent fixed @ Rs.1/- only, also makes it abundantly clear that, it was an 'Agreement of Sale' and not an 'Agreement of Lease' as such.  20. In this respect, learned counsel for the Respondents has also brought to the attention of this Court the definition of the 'Lease Premium', as given in the 'Agreement of Lease', meaning thereby, 'the premium consideration payable in respect of lease of the apartment'. It is urged that, Clause No.5.1 uses the term 'Customer' and not the 'Lessee' in the context of the Respondents. 14  21. According to learned counsel for the Respondents, all the terms and conditions of the 'Agreement of Lease' are pari materia to the terms and conditions of the 'Agreement', which is executed under the Maharashtra Ownership Flats (Regulation of the Promotion of Construction, Sale, Management and Transfer) Act, 1963, (for short, \"MOFA\"). In this respect, he has drawn attention of this Court to Clause No.10, which deals with 'Common Amenities and Facilities' and which, according to him, is the classic clause in the 'Agreement' executed under MOFA. Even Clause No.13 thereof relating to 'Statutory Payments' is also found often in the 'Agreement' executed under the MOFA. In his opinion and submission, therefore, here in the case, the intention of the parties was very much clear as to the \"sale\" of the said apartment by the Appellant to the Respondents. Hence, in no way, it can be called as an 'Agreement of Lease', though it is titled as such.  22. Moreover, according to him, if the Appellant has subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the RERA by registering under the RERA, which fact is not disputed, then Appellant cannot blow hot and cold at the same time by saying that, the Adjudicating Authority under the RERA has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint filed under Section 18 of the RERA. It is urged by him that, the provisions of the RERA are beneficial both to the 'Allottee' and also to the 'Promoter'. If the Appellant, in its capacity as 'Promoter', is availing the benefits given under the RERA, 15  then, under Section 115 of the Evidence Act, Appellant is estopped from contending that the 'Adjudicating Authority' has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaints made under Section 18 of the RERA.  23. As regards the contention of the Appellant that, only some components of the project were registered under the RERA, it is pointed out that, the 'Registration Certificate' does not reflect so. Though under the RERA, there is a specific provision for registration of only part of the project, the Appellant has registered the entire project under the RERA and availed the benefits thereunder. Now by refusing to submit itself to the jurisdiction of the 'Adjudicating Authority' under the RERA, the Appellant is, as good as, calling upon the said Authority not to consider, ignore or revoke its registration. It is submitted that, under the RERA, there is a separate 'Authority' for registration and revocation of the registration. It cannot be done by the 'Adjudicating Authority'. The 'Adjudicating Authority' cannot go behind the 'Registration Certificate' and hold that, the provisions of the RERA are not applicable to the Appellant. According to learned counsel for the Respondents, therefore, there is a great dichotomy in the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the Appellant, which cannot be upheld at all. Therefore, the impugned order passed by the Appellate Tribunal, holding that the provisions of the RERA are equally applicable to the Appellant and the 'Adjudicating Authority' under the RERA has jurisdiction to entertain 16  the complaints filed by the Respondents, being just, legal, correct and in tune and in consonance with the 'Objects and Reasons' of the RERA, no interference is warranted in the said orders.  24. In the light of these rival submissions, advanced by learned counsel for the parties and having regard to the factual aspects of the case and the provisions of the RERA, the three substantial questions of law are raised in these Second Appeals, on which the Appeals are admitted and the parties were heard finally at the stage of admission itself. Those questions can be stated as follows :-  (i) Whether the Appellate Tribunal has committed an error in holding that, the provisions of the RERA are applicable to the 'Agreement of Lease' executed between Appellant and Respondents?  (ii) Whether the Appellate Tribunal has committed an error in holding that, the 'Adjudicating Authority' under the RERA has jurisdiction to entertain the complaints filed by the Respondents, under Section 18 of RERA?  (iii) Whether the Adjudicating Authority, under the RERA, can go behind the 'Registration Certificate' of the Appellant, so as to hold that it has no jurisdiction, though the project is registered under the said Act? 17  Point No.1  25. In order to decide these substantial questions of law raised in these Second Appeals, it is necessary to consider in detail the provisions of the RERA, along with its 'Objects and Reasons'.  26. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, as its 'Preamble' shows, is enacted by the Legislature,  \"To establish the 'Real Estate Regulatory Authority' for regulation and promotion of the real estate sector and to ensure sale of plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, or sale of real estate project in an efficient and transparent manner and to protect the interest of consumers in the real estate sector and to establish an adjudicating mechanism for speedy redressal and also to establish the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal to hear Appeals from the decisions, directions or orders of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority and Adjudicating Officer and for the matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\"  27. The 'Statement of Objects and Reasons' of the Act shows that, the necessity of enacting such Act was realized by the Legislature after perceiving that,  The real estate sector plays a catalytic role in fulfilling the need and demand for housing and infrastructure in the country. While this sector has grown significantly in recent years, it has been largely unregulated, with 18  absence of professionalism and standardization and lack of adequate consumer protection.\"  28. It was felt that,  \"Though the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 is available as a forum to the buyers in the real estate market, the recourse thereto is only curative and is not adequate to address all the concerns of buyers and promoters in that sector.\"  29. The lack of standardization was found to be a constraint to the healthy and orderly growth of real estate industry. In view of the above, it was found necessary to have a Central Legislation, namely, the RERA, in the interests of effective consumer protection, uniformity and standardization of business practices and transactions in the real estate sector.  30. The RERA is, therefore, enacted to provide for establishment of the 'Real Estate Regulation and Development Authority' for regulation and promotion of real estate sector and to ensure sale of plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in an efficient and transparent manner. The object of the RERA is stated to be to protect the interests of consumers in the real estate sector, like the Respondents herein.  31. Thus, the RERA is brought on Statute Book to ensure greater accountability towards the consumers and significantly reduce frauds 19  and delays, as also the current high transaction costs. It attempts to balance the interests of consumers and promoters, by imposing certain responsibilities on both. It seeks to establish symmetry of information between the promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions and set minimum standards of accountability and a fast track dispute resolution mechanism. The RERA, as stated in its 'Objects and Reasons', was enacted for inducting professionalism and standardization in the sector, thus, paving the way for accelerated growth and investments in the long run.  32. The RERA, therefore, imposes an obligation upon the promoter not to book, sell or offer for sale or invite persons to purchase any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project, without registering the real estate project with the Authority. It makes the registration of real estate project compulsory, in case where the area of land proposed to be developed exceed 500 sq.mtrs. or number of apartments proposed to be developed exceed 8, inclusive of all phases. It imposes an obligation upon the Real Estate Agent also not to facilitate sale or purchase of any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, without registering himself with the Authority. The Act imposes liability upon the Promoter to pay such compensation to the Allottees in the manner, as provided under RERA, in case if he fails to discharge any obligations imposed on him under RERA. 20  33. When the Constitutional validity of the RERA was challenged in the case of  ,   Bom. 9302, along with connected matters, by the various Developers and Promoters on the ground that, its provisions are discriminatory against them, the Division Bench of this Court was pleased to consider all the provisions of the RERA in their entirety and after having regard to its 'Objects and Reasons', held that,  \"The RERA law is not to be considered as anti- promoter. It is a law for regulation and development of the real estate sector. Under the scheme of the RERA, the promoter's interests are also safeguarded and there is a reason for the same. Unless a professional promoter making genuine efforts is not protected, then very purpose of development of real estate sector would be defeated.\"  34. The apprehensions, therefore, expressed on behalf of the Petitioners therein, namely, the Developers, in the said regard were held to be not well founded.  35. From the material placed on record during the course of the hearing, the Division Bench was pleased to observe its realisation that,  \"A very large number of people spread over various cities across the country have invested their hard- earned money in the real estate project for securing roof over their heads. For millions of people, a 21  dwelling house in this country is still a dream come true. The respective Governments, Corporations have declared beneficial schemes for low and high income groups for allotment of residential houses. However, that is not proving to be sufficient. The hard-earned money of the consumers, their life-time savings were invested in many such projects. It was found that many projects are lying idle for various reasons, due to which public at large, consumers of real estate sector are adversely affected financially and otherwise. A comprehensive law was the need of the day. The Parliament, therefore, thought it fit to comprehend under one umbrella regulatory mechanism for a disciplined growth of the real estate sector.\"  36. It was, thus, held that,  \"If the RERA is for the benefits of both the 'Allottees' and the 'Promoters', then there is no substance in the challenge to the Constitutional validity of the said Act.\"  37. Thus, it can be seen that, the enactment of the RERA is to meet the need of an hour. The need of the hour is to regulate this real estate industry and to ensure that some standardization and professionalism is brought into this real estate sector, which would help to protect not only the interests of the 'Allottees', the purchasers of the flats/the apartments, who have invested their hard-earned money to get the home of their dream, but also to protect the interests of the 'Promoters', 22  as without protecting their interests, the interests of the 'Allottees' or the 'Consumers' also cannot be safeguarded. The Act is enacted also to encourage the growth of the real estate industry, so that the common man's dream of a dwelling house can be fulfilled. The RERA is, therefore, essentially for regulation and healthy growth of the real estate sector.  38. The provisions of the Act are hence required to be construed and interpreted keeping in mind these 'Objects and Reasons' of the Act in the backdrop of the facts and reality on ground, which made it necessary to have some comprehensive law on the subject.  39. Section 2 of the Act gives definitions of the important terms used in the Act.  40. In the context of the 'Agreements of Lease', which are executed by the Appellant with the Respondents, in this case, the definitions of the terms \"Allottee\", as defined in Section 2(d) of the Act; \"Agreement for Sale\", as laid down in Section 2(c) of the Act, the word \"promoter\", as defined in Section 2(z) of the Act, and the term \"Real Estate Project\", as defined in Section 2(zn) of the Act, are very much relevant for understanding and interpreting the scope of the 'Agreements' entered into by the parties in this case. Hence, they are reproduced as follows :- 23  \"2(c). \"Agreement for Sale\" means an agreement entered into between the Promoter and the Allottee. 2(d). \"Allottee\", in relation to a real estate project, means the person to whom a plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, has been allotted, sold (whether as freehold or leasehold) or otherwise transferred by the Promoter, and includes the person who subsequently acquires the said allotment through sale, transfer or otherwise, but does not include a person to whom such plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, is given on rent.  2(zk). \"Promoter\" means :-  (i) a person who constructs or causes to be constructed an independent building or a building consisting of apartments, or converts an existing building or a part thereof into apartments, for the purpose of selling all or some of the apartments to other persons and includes his assignees; or  (ii) a person who develops land into a project, whether or not the person also constructs structures on any of the plots, for the purpose of selling to other persons all or some of the plots in the said project, whether with or without structures thereon; or  (iii) any development authority or any other public body in respect of allottees of -  (a) buildings or apartments, as the case may be, constructed by such authority or body 24  on lands owned by them or placed at their disposal by the Government; or  (b) plots owned by such authority or body or placed at their disposal by the Government,  for the purpose of selling all or some of the apartments or plots; or  (iv) an apex State level Co-operative Housing Finance Society and a primary Co-operative Housing Society, which constructs apartments or buildings for its Members or in respect of the allottees of such apartments or buildings; or  (v) any other person, who acts himself as a builder, coloniser, contractor, developer, estate developer or by any other name or claims to be acting as the holder of a power of attorney from the owner of the land on which the building or apartment is constructed or plot is developed for sale; or  (vi) such other person, who constructs any building or apartment for sale to the general public. 2(zn). \"Real Estate Project\" means the development of a building or a building consisting of apartments, or converting an existing building or a part thereof into apartments, or the development of land into plots or apartments, as the case may be, for the purpose of selling all or some of the said apartments or plots or building, as the case may be, and includes the common areas, the development works, all improvements and structures thereon, and all easement, rights and appurtenances belonging thereto.\" 25  41. The terms \"Apartment\" and \"Building\" are defined in Section 2(e) and 2(j) of the RERA Act, respectively, and they cover not only the residential property, but also the commercial property, such as offices, show rooms, shops or godowns. In that sense, the RERA has wide scope and coverage in the real estate projects.  42. In this context, vis-a-vis, these definitions given in the RERA, it would be essential to go through the 'Agreements' executed between the parties. No doubt, it is true, that the 'Agreements' are titled as 'Agreements of Lease'. The word \"Rent\" is also defined therein to mean 'the yearly rent amount payable by the customer to Lavasa, once the lease is actually granted in respect of the apartment'. The term 'Annual Rent' is defined to be Rs.1/- and the 'period of lease' is stated to be \"999 years\". Clause No.4(xi) of the 'Agreement' is relevant in that respect. It says that, 'under its Township Development Scheme, Lavasa proposes to construct 'Lake Views' on the 'Lots' identified by it and grant on lease, the apartments constructed therein for a period of 999 years on the notionally divided pieces of land termed as \"Lots\".'  43. Clause No.5.1 of the 'Agreement' further provides that, in consideration of the customer having expressly agreed to pay to Lavasa the lease premium, which is in the range of Rs.32 to 40 lakhs, as the case may be, and which is more than 80% of the total consideration amount 26  and the annual lease rent of Rs.1/- for the said apartment, Lavasa agrees to grant to the customer a lease for a period of 999 years for the said apartment.  44. Clause No.5.2 of the 'Agreement' provides that, the 'Lease Deed' was to be executed only after the development and construction of the said apartment has been fully completed and all the lease premium amounts are paid by the customer to Lavasa. The lease term was to commence from the date of execution of the registration of the 'Lease Deed' by Lavasa in respect of the said apartment in favour of the customer.  45. Clause No.6 of the 'Agreement' lays down the 'Schedule of the Payment', which shows that the payment was to be made as per the progress in the construction and except for some nominal amount, entire consideration was to be paid before possession was to be delivered. This clause is a typical clause, which is normally found in the 'Agreement of Sale' under MOFA. Clause No.9.1 states that, the possession of the apartment was to be handed over within a period of 24 months, on the customer depositing the entire lease premium installments.  46. Further clauses in the 'Agreement', like Clause No.10 pertaining to 27  'Common Amenities and Facilities'; Clause No.12.1 pertaining to 'Charges and Contributions towards the Maintenance and Amenities'; Clause No.13 relating to 'Statutory Payments' and even other clauses in the 'Agreement' are more or less the same like the ones which are necessarily found in the 'Agreement of Sale' executed under MOFA. As a matter of fact, though these Agreements are titled as 'Agreements of Lease', they are just the replicas of the 'Agreement of Sale', which is executed under the MOFA, except for the words 'lease' and 'rent' used therein.  47. Thus, if the entire 'Agreement' is perused as such, then it becomes apparent on the face of it also, that it cannot be termed or treated as an 'Agreement of Lease', but, in its real purport, it is an 'Agreement of Sale'. The very fact that more than 80% of the entire consideration amount is already paid by the Respondents to the Appellant and the lease premium agreed is only of Rs.1/- per annum, including the clause relating to the period of lease of 999 years, are self-speaking to prove that, in reality, the transaction entered into by the parties is an 'Agreement of Sale' and not an 'Agreement of Lease'; though it is titled as such. The law is well settled that the nomenclature of the document cannot be a true test of its real intent and the document has to be read as a whole to ascertain the intention of the parties. 28  48. Needless to state that, in an 'Agreement of Lease', the 'Lessee' does not pay more than 80% of the consideration amount towards the price of the said apartment. In an 'Agreement of Lease', the rent cannot be Rs.1/- per annum only, for such an apartment, market rate of which is more than Rs.40 lakhs. In an 'Agreement of Lease', parties do not pay the registration charges and stamp duty on the market value of the said apartment. The 'Agreement of Lease' also cannot be for such a long term for '999 years'. This long period of lease in itself is sufficient to hold that, it is not an 'Agreement of Lease', but, in reality, an 'Agreement of Sale'.  49. In this context, learned counsel for the Appellant has rightly placed reliance on the Judgment of the Madras High Court in the case of  , in Tax Case (Appeal) No.1031 of 2007; decided on 7 April 2014), wherein, reliance was placed on the Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of  , Nagpur and Bhandara, 1988 (172) ITR 311, holding that,  \"Having regard to the lease of plot for 99 years, it is clear that, under the lease in question, the Assessee has parted with an asset of an enduring nature, namely, the rights to possession and enjoyment of the properties leased for a period of 99 years, such transaction amounts to transfer of capital assets, as contemplated under Section 12B of the Income Tax Act, 1922.\" 29  50. Relying on this decision of the Apex Court in this Judgment, the Madras High Court has also held that, \"Having regard to the fact that the period of lease was of 99 years, it was as good as a lease in perpetuity or a permanent lease in as much as an alienation as a sale\". It was further held that, \"the mere use of the word 'lease' or the fact that a long term is fixed would not by itself make the document in lease. The payment of lumpsum amount also does not make it a permanent lease any the less an alienation than a sale\".  51. Here in the case, the period of lease being of '999 years'; it is as good as the transaction in perpetuity. The payment of entire consideration amount and the lease premium @ Rs.1/- per annum only, further make the intention clear that, it was not an 'Agreement of Lease', but, clearly an alienation, which can be called as 'sale'.  52. As to the contention of learned counsel for the Appellant that this Judgment of the Madras High Court pertains to the assessment under the Income Tax Act, in my considered opinion, even if it is so, the ratio laid down therein, which is pertaining to the legal aspects as to when the document titled as a 'lease' can be considered as an 'alienation by sale' is equally applicable to the facts of the present case also. 30  53. In this respect, this Court has also to consider the provisions of the RERA, which are required to be construed, having regard to its objects and reasons. When the very object of the RERA is to protect the consumers, the persons, who have invested their hard-earned money by entering into an 'Agreement', which is in the nature of purchase of the apartment itself, mere nomenclature of the document as 'Agreement of Lease' will not in any way take away the rights given to them by the statute.  54. Though much reliance is placed by learned counsel for the Appellant on the definition of the word \"Allottee\", as given in Section 2(d) of the RERA, to contend that the Allottee does not include a person to whom such plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, is \"given on rent\", it must be remembered that, the definition of the term 'Allottee' in the present context includes even when the plot sold is a \"freehold or leasehold\". To that extent, it has to be held that, the definition of 'Allottee' also includes the 'Lease Agreement', though it may not include such Agreement, when the apartment is in its real sense given purely on rent and it is, in reality, an 'Agreement of Rent and Lease' and not, in effect, a transaction of sale. The object of the RERA, it may be recalled, is to regulate the real estate industry, to ensure greater accountability towards consumers and significantly to reduce frauds and delays, to bring into it the standardization, professionalism and the transparency, 31  so that interests of the consumers are protected. In that view of the matter, the intention of the Legislature was to protect those persons like Respondents, who have invested substantial amounts in the real estate projects. Hence, they are required to be called as 'Consumers' or 'Allottees'. If they are excluded from the definition of 'Allottee' and thereby from the protection given under the Act, by giving restrictive meaning to the term 'Allottee', the very object of the Act would stand frustrated.  55. Here in the case, Respondents have already invested more than 80% of the consideration amount of the said apartment in the Real Estate Project of the Appellant. Their interests in the project undertaken by the Appellant are that of the 'Allottees', who have entered into such 'Agreements' for the purpose of purchase of the said flat/apartment. The object of the RERA cannot be to exclude such persons, who have invested huge amount in the Real Estate Project, may be under the 'Agreement of Lease' and taken such apartment on the lease of '999 years', which transaction is, in reality, the transaction of sale. 56. As rightly submitted by learned counsel for the Respondents, the definitions of the terms \"Allottee\", \"Promoter\" and \"Real Estate Project\"  are required to be construed harmoniously in the light of the 'Objects and Reasons' of the RERA. As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of  , (1992) 1 SCC 335, 32  \"When the question arises as to the meaning of a certain provision in a statute, it is not only legitimate, but proper to read that provision in its context. The 'context' means, 'the statute as a whole, the previous state of the law, other statutes in pari materia, the general scope of the statute and the mischief, that it was intended to remedy.\"  57. It is a rule now firmly established that the intention of the Legislature must be found by reading the statute as a whole. Every clause of a statute has to be construed with reference to the context of the other clauses of the Act, to make a consistent enactment of the whole statute. An isolated consideration of the definitions may not give justice to the objects and reasons of the Act and the intention of the Legislature.  58. In this context, the 'Heydon's Rule of Suppression of Mischief' is required to be considered and highlighted. In Heydon's case ( ), it was held that,  \"For the sure and true interpretation of a statute in general (be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common law), four things are to be discerned and considered:  1 - What was the common law before the making of the Act ?  2 - What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide ? 33  3 - What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth, and  4 - The true reason of the remedy; and then the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro private commodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico.\"  59. Thus, what was the mischief, which is tried to be suppressed by enactment of this Act, needs to be considered. In respect of this enactment, the mischief was to ameliorate the sufferings of the persons, who have invested their hard-earned money in the real estate sector. The object of the RERA is to protect the 'Allottees' and simplify the remedying of the wrongs committed by the 'Promoter'. The RERA assures completion of project in time-bound manner. The main object is to ensure accountability on the part of the Real Estate Sector and to provide a comprehensive, effective and speedy remedy to the persons, who have invested large sums of money for having a home of their dreams. The very enactment of the Act was found necessary, because it was noticed that all over the country in large number of projects, the Allottees did not get possession for years together. Huge amount of money was found locked in. Hence, to suppress this mischief and to 34  provide effective remedy to the consumers, this law was enacted. One of the modes prescribed under the Act to regulate the Real Estate Sector was to impose some penalty on the Developer, who has failed to complete the project in stipulated time. The provisions of Section 18 of the Act are in that way compensatory in nature. As held by this Court in the case of Neelkamal Realtors Suburban Pvt. Ltd. (Supra),  \"When the 'Promoter' is, in effect, constructing the apartments for the 'Allottees' and the 'Allottees' make the payment of premium, the Act requires the 'Promoter' to pay interest to the 'Allottees', whose money it is, when the project is delayed beyond the contractual/agreed period. When the 'Allottee' has parted with entire consideration for purchase of the apartment and still he is not given possession and the 'Promoter' is enjoying the benefit of the said amount of consideration, it is expected under the Act that he is bound to pay compensation to the 'Allottee'. In other words, it becomes a case of unjust enrichment on the part of the 'Promoter', if he is not liable to compensate the 'Allottees' by paying interest on the amount retained by him, the 'Authority' under the RERA also can impose penalty or interest on the 'Allottees' for contravention of the obligations cast upon both of them, in view of Section 38 of the Act. Thus, the legislation has done balancing of rights and liabilities of 'Promoters' and 'Allottees'.\"  60. Now here in the facts of the present case, the Appellant has availed more than 80% of the consideration amount of the apartments booked 35  by the Respondents. Respondents had also paid registration charges and stamp-duty on the purchase price of the said apartments. Therefore, they are now entitled to get the benefits, which are given under the Act to such Allottees, as in that sense, they become the 'Allottees' of the apartments. Depriving them from enjoying the remedy available under Section 18 of the Act is as good as allowing the unjust enrichment on the part of the Appellant. That will defeat the object of the Legislature, with which this Act was enacted.  61. Once it is accepted that the Act was legislated to bring some discipline, professionalism, transparency and standardization in all the projects of real estate sector, then excluding from its scope the 'Agreements' like the ones, executed in the present case, is as good as frustrating the very object of the said Act. If the object of this Act is to ensure greater accountability towards consumer and reduce delays in completion of the real estate projects, then to hold that the agreements of the present nature, in which the Respondents have invested the substantial amount of consideration with an expectation of completion of the project within 24 months, as assured in the 'Agreements', is nothing but defeating the very purpose of the Act. Therefore, as held in Heydon's Rule, the interpretation of the statute has to be not only to suppress the mischief, but also to advance the remedy and also to suppress subtle inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief. Interpretation 36  of the provisions should be such as it will add force and life to the cure and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act and not to defeat that intent.  62. The provisions of any statute for that matter, as held by the Apex Court in the case of  , (2000) 5 SCC 346, are required to be considered in their practical application, as to how they will achieve the object of the Act. In this Judgment, the Hon'ble Apex Court has very lucidly and effectively held that;  \"15. 'Statutes', it is often said, should be construed not as theorems of Euclid, but with some imagination of the purposes, which lie behind them, and to be too literal in the meaning of words is to see the skin and miss the soul. The method suggested for adoption, in cases of doubt as to the meaning of the words used, is to explore the intention of the Legislature through the words, the context, which gives the colour, the context, the subject-matter, the effects and consequences or the spirit and reason of the law. The general words and collocation or phrases, howsoever wide or comprehensive in their literal sense, are interpreted from the context and scheme underlying in the text of the Act. The decision in  , (1987) 3 SCC 279, case also emphasizes the need to construe the words in a provision in the context of the scheme underlying the other provisions of the Act as well, which ultimately was considered to be in tune with the object set out in the 'Statement of the Objects and Reasons' and in the 37  'Preamble'. Apart from the fact that the observations contained in the decision have to be understood in the light of the issue raised and exercise undertaken by the Court therein, the fallacy in the submission on behalf of the Appellant lies, though not in the principles of construction to be adopted, but in the assumption of the counsel to confine or restrict and construe the law in question to be one made to regulate the trade of sawing, contrary to the very 'Preamble', which reads,  \"to make provisions for regulating in the public interest the establishment and operation of saw-mills and saw-pits and trade of sawing for the protection and conservation of forest and the environment\".\"  63. It needs to be emphasized that, the too literal meaning of the words given in the Statute is to not understand the scheme underlying the provisions of the Act. The intention of the Legislature has to be gathered not only from the terms used, but also from the 'Objects and Reasons' and 'Preamble' to the said legislation. Here in the case, the very 'object' of this comprehensive legislation is to ensure that, the consumers do not suffer, by whichever name or nomenclature they are called or under whichever document, they entered into an 'Agreement'. In the very 'Objects and Reasons' of the Act, it was clearly stated that, the Consumer Protection Act, 1986, is though available as a forum to the 'Buyers' in the real estate market, the recourse is only curative and is not adequate to 38  address all the concerns of the 'Buyers' and 'Promoters' in that sector. Hence, it was found that, for this lack of adequate consumer protection, which, to some extent, was given by the specific statute, like MOFA, being not available in other statutes and to all the consumers to protect their interests effectively, this Act was enacted. Now allowing the Respondents to remain out of the purview of this Act, merely because their 'Agreements' are titled as 'Agreement of Lease', will not give justice to the provisions of this Act also.  64. Another object of the Act was also to bring under the umbrella of 'Adjudicating Authority' all the disputes between the Buyers on the one hand and the Promoters, Developers and Development Authorities on the other hand in respect of the Real Estate Projects undertaken by them. The Division Bench of this Court in the case of Neelkamal Realtors (Supra) has considered this adequate mechanism provided under the Act for balancing rights of 'Allottees' and 'Promoters', by observing in paragraph No.124, as follows :-  \"The entire scheme of the RERA is required to be kept in mind. It is already submitted during the course of hearing that, in many cases, helpless Allottees had approached Consumer Forum, High Courts, Apex Court in a given fact situation of the case. The Courts have been passing orders by moulding reliefs by granting interest, compensation to the Allottees and issuing directions for timely completion of project, transit accommodation during completion of 39  project, so on and so forth. Under the RERA, now this function is assigned to the Authority, Tribunal. An Appeal lies to the High Court. Under one umbrella, under on regulation and one law, all the issues are tried to be resolved.\"  65. Thus, it can be seen that the object of establishing this 'adjudicating mechanism' was to provide for speedy dispute redressal by bringing all the disputes under one umbrella. This 'redressal mechanism' is to ensure that, the consumers like the Respondents, who have invested their large amount of hard-earned money in the real estate projects, should get its returns at the earliest, either in the form of completion of the projects and possession of the apartments, or, by way of compensation with interests. If the Respondents, who have invested such money, are not allowed to approach this 'Adjudicating Authority', established under the RERA, and the 'Adjudicating Authority' merely holds that, as the 'Agreement' is titled as an 'Agreement of Lease', it has no jurisdiction to entertain their grievances raised under Section 18 of the said Act, then such interpretation cannot be in consonance and in tune with the object of the Act.  66. The Appellate Tribunal has, therefore, rightly held that, if one has to adopt the object-oriented approach, then without even doing violations to the plain language used in the statute, such approach can be adopted in the instant case, keeping in mind the principle that 40  legislative futility is to be avoided, so long as interpretative possibility permits. These are the observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of   and Co.,  , quoted with approval in the case of  , (2009) 15 SCC 275;  \"19. The Courts, while interpreting the provisions of any Act, should, no doubt, adopt an object-oriented approach, keeping in mind the principle that, legislative futility is to be avoided so long as interpretative possibility permits. But, at the same time, the Courts will have to keep in mind that, the object-oriented approach cannot be carried to the extent of doing violence to the plain language used in the statute, by re- writing the words of a statute in place of the actual words used, or, by ignoring definite words used in the statute.\"  67. Here in the case, as regards the word \"Allottee\", as a matter of fact, it can never be the intention of the Legislature to exclude long term leases from the purview of the Act; otherwise, the Legislature would not have used the words 'freehold' or 'leasehold', when it has defined the term 'Allottee', under Section 2(d) of the Act.  68. Moreover, exclusion of such long term lease from the purview of the Act would be defeating the very object of the Act. The Developer- Promoter may, in such cases, by executing the 'Agreement' with the 41  nomenclature as the 'Agreement of Lease', can very conveniently escape from the clutches of the provisions of this Act. When the Legislature has stated in the definition of the term 'Allottee' that it does not include the person, to whom the plot, apartment or building is \"given on rent\", the intention of the Legislature was only to exclude pure 'Agreements of Lease' or the 'rent', as the Lessees therein have not invested the substantial amount, like purchase price, of the apartment in completion of the project. One may also include therein licenses, but one cannot exclude the persons, who have invested more than 80% of the purchase price of the apartment. One also cannot exclude the transactions, in which the apartment was to be built and then the possession thereof was to be handed over on payment of the entire consideration amount at the market rate. Such 'Agreements' can in no way be called as 'Agreements of Lease' at all. The intention of the Legislature, which is found reflected in the 'Objects and Reasons' of the Act and its various provisions, makes it abundantly clear that, to all the projects, wherein the possession of the apartments is to be handed over in consideration of the sale price or the market price, such projects are included under the purview of this Act. It has to be held that, the Legislature would have never intended to exclude the persons like the Respondents, who have invested their hard- earned money in such projects, from the protective and beneficial provisions of this Act. 42  69. As held by this Court in the case of Neelkamal Realtors Suburban Pvt. Ltd. (Supra),  \"The provisions like Section 4(2)(l)(D) of RERA, which contemplates that, 'promoter' should deposit 70% of the amounts realized for the real estate project from the 'Allottees' in a separate account, which means that 30% of the amounts realized by the 'Promoter' from the 'Allottees' will be retained by him and in such case, if the 'Promoter' defaults to handover possession to the 'Allottees' in the agreed time-limit or the extended one, then the 'Allottees' shall reasonably expect such compensation from the 'Promoter' till the handing over of the possession, are necessarily incorporated; because, it was noticed by the 'Select Committee' and the 'Standing Committee' of the 'Parliament' that, huge sums of money collected from the 'Allottees' were not utilized fully in the projects, or, the amounts collected from the 'Allottees' were diverted to other sectors, than the concerned project.\"  70. Here in the case also, the consideration amount for the apartments agreed to be handed over to the Respondents is already obtained by the Appellant. As per the 'Agreement', the possession of the apartments was to be delivered within 24 months from that date; however, even after the lapse of 7 years, the Respondents have not received the possession; thereby indicating default on the part of the Appellant in fulfilling his obligations. If such 'Allottees', like the Respondents herein, cannot be 43  kept out of the purview of the Act, which is clearly enacted with express intent to ensure that, they get the succor. At the cost of repetition, it has to be stated that, the mischief, to suppress which, the Act was enacted, was that there was no law regulating the real estate sector development work and obligations of 'Promoters' and 'Allottees'. This need was felt by the 'Parliament', because, it was noticed that, all over the country, in large number of projects, the 'Allottees' did not get possession for years together and huge sums of money of the 'Allottees' was locked in such projects. Hence, if, in the similar situation and fact, the funds of the Respondents are locked in the development projects of the Appellant, they cannot be deprived from the benefit of this Act, merely on the count that the 'Agreements' executed by them with the Appellant are titled as 'Agreement to Lease' and not 'Agreement of Sale'.  71. Here the Hayden's Rule of Suppression of Mischief needs to be applied with full force and if that Rule is applied, then the provisions of the RERA are required to be held as equally applicable to the long term leases, like the present one of \"999 years\"; or, where the substantial amount of consideration is already obtained by the 'Developer'. Then the definitions of the terms 'Allottee', or, 'Real Estate Project', or, even that of 'Promoter', are required to be interpreted in that context and not in isolation, by placing reliance simplicitor on the word 'selling' used in these three definitions. As rightly submitted by learned counsel for the 44  Respondents, the word 'selling' is grammatical variation of the word \"sold\", used in section 2(d) of the Act in the definition of the term \"Allottee\". If the allotment of a plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, can be whether as a freehold or as leasehold, then the word 'selling' used in the definitions of 'Promoter' and 'Real Estate Project' also includes the allotment of a plot by lease. Merely because the Legislature has excluded the allotment, when it is given on rent, it does not exclude the long term lease like the present one. That will be defeating and frustrating the object of the Act and hence, it has to be held that the Appellate Tribunal has rightly held that, so far as the present case is concerned, considering the long term lease of '999 years', it would definitely amount to sale.  Point Nos.2 and 3  72. In the facts of the present case, there is one more reason to hold that Respondents' complaints filed under Section 18 of the Act are maintainable before the 'Adjudicating Authority'. It is because the Appellant itself has registered this project under the RERA and accepted its liabilities under the Act.  73. Section 3 of the RERA in this respect is assuming significance and it can be reproduced as follows :- 45 Section 3 : \"Prior registration of Real Estate Project with Real Estate Regulatory Authority\"  (1) No Promoter shall advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale, or invite persons to purchase in any manner any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any Real Estate Project or part of it, in any planning area, without registering the Real Estate Project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority established under this Act:  Provided that, projects that are on-going on the date of commencement of this Act and for which the Completion Certificate has not been issued, the Promoter shall make an application to the Authority for registration of the said project within a period of three months from the date of commencement of this Act:  Provided further that, if the Authority thinks necessary, in the interest of Allottees, for projects, which are developed beyond the planning area but with the requisite permission of the local authority, it may, by order, direct the Promoter of such project to register with the Authority, and the provisions of this Act or the rules and regulations made thereunder, shall apply to such projects from that stage of registration.  (2) Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), no registration of the Real Estate Project shall be required-  (a) where the area of land proposed to be developed does not exceed five hundred square meters or the number of apartments proposed to be developed does not exceed eight inclusive of all phases:  Provided that, if the appropriate Government considers it necessary, it may, reduce the threshold 46  below five hundred square meters or eight apartments, as the case may be, inclusive of all phases, for exemption from registration under this Act;  (b) where the Promoter has received Completion Certificate for a Real Estate Project prior to commencement of this Act;  (c) for the purpose of renovation or repair or re- development, which does not involve marketing, advertising, selling or new allotment of any apartment, plot or building, as the case may be, under the Real Estate Project.  Explanation - For the purpose of this Section, where the Real Estate Project is to be developed in phases, every such phase shall be considered a stand alone Real Estate Project, and the Promoter shall obtain registration under this Act for each phase separately.\"  74. This Section thus makes registration of the project mandatory for its sale. As per Clause (2) of Section 3, the RERA is made applicable even to the projects that are on-going on the date of commencement of the RERA and for which, Completion Certificate has not been issued. In respect of such projects also, Promoters are required to register the projects with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority within three months from the commencement of the RERA, with an option that they can register entire real estate project or part of it. The specific 'Explanation' to the Section 3 of the RERA provides that, where the real estate project 47  is to be developed in phases, every such phase shall be considered as a stand alone real estate project and the Promoter shall obtain registration under this Act for each phase separately. This 'Explanation' is important for the purpose of the present litigation, as here in the case, the Appellant has already got itself registered under RERA, by making an application under Section 4 of the said Act. The 'Registration Certificate' is produced on record proving that, the entire project as such is registered and not only certain components thereof. It is not the case of the Appellant also that only some parts of the components of the said project are registered. Though it is contended that, the RERA is applicable only to some part of the project, despite that, the entire project is registered under the RERA, as is evident from the 'Registration Certificate'.  75. Hence, there is definitely some substance in the submission advanced by learned counsel for the Respondents that, if the Appellant has registered itself under the RERA, it follows that Appellant has submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the RERA. Now Appellant cannot contend that the provisions of Section 18 of the RERA are not applicable to it, as the 'Agreements' executed with the Respondents are 'Agreements of Lease' and not an 'Agreement of Sale'. As rightly submitted by learned counsel for the Respondents, by registering itself under the RERA and availing the benefits, which were available under 48  the RERA, now Appellant cannot approbate and reprobate by contending that, the said provisions are applicable only to a particular aspect and not to the complaints, which are filed by the Respondents and that too merely on the count that, the 'Agreements' executed with the Respondents are the 'Agreements of Lease' and not 'Agreement of Sale'. By volunteering to register itself under the RERA, Appellant has surrendered itself to the jurisdiction of the Adjudicating Authority, established under the RERA. The option was available to the Appellant to register only part of the project and not the entire or part of the project, in respect of which the 'Agreements of Lease' are executed. The Appellant had not exercised that option. Without any qualification or reservation, Appellant has registered the entire project with RERA. Appellant cannot, therefore, contend that, the Adjudicating Authority established under the RERA has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaints filed by the Respondents-Allottees under Section 18 of the said Act. The provisions of the RERA cannot be bifurcated in the sense that, only in respect of certain aspects, the Appellant can avail benefit of the said Act; by registering itself and as per its convenience, whenever Appellant has to comply with the obligations therein, it can raise contention that the provisions of the RERA are not applicable, because it is an 'Agreement of Lease'. The provisions of Section 115 of the Evidence Act definitely prevents, precludes and estopps the Appellant from doing so. 49  76. Moreover, if the Appellant is permitted to raise such defence, it would be as good as allowing the 'Adjudicating Authority', established under the RERA, to go behind the Registration Certificate for holding that the said registration under RERA is not applicable to the project of the Appellant. Can the Adjudicating Authority do so? The answer has to be in the negative, if the scheme of the RERA is considered. It is pertinent to note that, under the RERA, there are two different Authorities established; one is Real Estate Regulatory Authority, which is defined under Section 2(1) and established under Section 20 of the RERA. It is conferred with the jurisdiction to entertain the application for registration of the projects. As can be seen from the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the RERA, application for registration of real estate project is to be made to this Real Estate Regulatory Authority, established under Section 20 of the said Act. Chapter 'V' of the RERA deals with the 'Establishment and Incorporation of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority'. Section 21 thereof deals with 'Composition of the said Authority' and Section 22 thereof deals with 'Qualification of Chairperson and Members of the Authority'. It is for this Authority to consider whether to grant registration or not and in case of breach of terms and conditions on the part of the Promoter, whether to revoke the said registration under Section 7 of the Act. The Rules framed under the RERA are more than sufficient to that effect. 50  77. As against it, the Adjudicating Authority under the RERA is defined in Section 2(a) as the 'Adjudicating Officer' appointed under sub- section (1) of Section 71. This 'Adjudicating Authority', as can be seen from Section 71(1) of the Act, is established for the purpose of adjudging the compensation under Sections 12, 14, 18 and 19 of the said Act. Section 31 provides that, the complaints are to be filed by the aggrieved persons under the RERA with the 'Adjudicating Authority' for any violation or contravention of the provisions of this Act.  78. Therefore, the 'Authority', which grants registration under RERA, is different than the 'Authority', which is established to adjudicate the grievances of the aggrieved persons under the said Act. One Authority cannot encroach on the jurisdiction exercised or to be exercised by the another Authority. Here in the case, the 'Registration Certificate' to the Appellant is granted by the Regulatory Authority, established under Section 20 of the said Act and now the Appellant is calling upon the 'Adjudicating Authority', established under Section 71 of the RERA, to go behind that 'Registration Certificate' and to hold that the provisions of RERA are not applicable to the Appellant.  79. In my considered opinion, this course is not permissible under the law to challenge the Registration Certificate issued by one 'Authority' before the another 'Authority' and calling upon that 'Authority' not to 51  consider such 'Certificate of Registration' and then to hold that the RERA is not applicable to the said project. Once there is registration under the RERA, then it follows that, all the provisions of the RERA become applicable to such project, unless some phases are specifically excluded from registration. It also becomes applicable to the persons, who have invested in the said real estate project. It is applicable both, to the Appellant and also to the Respondents. The Appellant, after having taken the advantage of registration under the RERA, cannot turn back and say that the provisions of the RERA are not applicable to the complaints made by the Respondents in respect of the very same project.  80. As submitted by learned counsel for the Appellant, it may be true that, the registration alone cannot be a test to decide whether the provisions of the RERA are applicable or not; because, in that case, if the project is not registered, then, it will not be possible to accept that the provisions of the RERA are not applicable to such projects. However, in my considered opinion, this reasoning or logic cannot be applicable to the instant case, as Section 3 of the RERA mandates registration. It clearly provides that, no promoter shall even advertise, market, book, sell or offer for sale or invite persons to purchase, in any manner, any plot, apartment or building, as the case may be, in any real estate project or part of it, in any planning area, without registering the real estate 52  project with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority established under the RERA. Even in respect of ongoing projects also, this mandate applies, unless it is shown that, 'Completion Certificate' has been already issued. The word used in Section 3(1) and the Proviso to Section 3 in respect of 'ongoing project' is \"shall\", thereby making the intention of the legislature clear that, in respect of those ongoing projects also, the registration has to be sought within a period of three months from the date of commencement of the Act. Sub-clause (2) of Section 3 provides for some exceptions, where registration of real estate project shall not be required and those exceptions are pertaining to the projects, where the area of land proposed to be developed does not exceed 500 sq.mtrs., or, the number of apartments proposed to be developed does not exceed 8, inclusive of all phases, or, where the Promoter has received Completion Certificate prior to commencement of the Act. One more exception laid down in Clause (c) of sub-section (2) of Section 3 is that, when the project undertaken is for the purpose of renovation or repair or re- development, which does not involve marketing, advertising, selling or new allotment of any apartment, plot or building, as the case may be; otherwise, for all other Development Projects, the registration under the RERA is mandatory.  81. The Appellant had, therefore, no choice but to get their project registered under the RERA, considering that it was for development of 53  the plot, exceeding the area of more than 500 sq.mtrs. and it was for the number of apartments exceeding 8, inclusive of all phases. The Appellant's project is also not completed; at-least, as no Completion Certificate is obtained and, therefore, it is an on-going project. Thus, when the Registration Certificate for such real estate project was compulsory, in order to book, sell or offer for sale the plots or apartments constructed therein, and it was obtained accordingly, then Appellant can no more contend that such Registration Certificate will not be applicable for the construction of the apartments in the said project and to the Allottees, who have entered into 'Agreements' in respect of the said apartments.  82. It is pertinent to note that, if, according to the Appellant also, the project undertaken was not of \"development\" and \"sale of the apartments\" constructed therein, then the Appellant was not bound to register the same and would not have registered the same, under Section 3 of the RERA. If the Appellant has also understood the 'Agreements' executed with the Respondents as only 'Agreements of Lease', then Appellant could have very well avoided the registration under the RERA; because, in that case, Appellant could have contended that, it is not bound by Section 3 of the RERA, as the project was not undertaken for \"sale of the flats\" or the apartments, but only for the purpose of giving the apartments \"on rent\". The very fact that the Appellant has got itself 54  registered under the RERA makes it necessary to infer that, the Appellant was very well aware that this project was for sale of the apartments constructed in the project and that is why, it was bound by the provisions of the RERA.  83. Moreover, here there is no question of applying the logic that, if the project is not registered, whether the RERA will not be applicable, even if it is otherwise proved to be a project of development, because, as per the mandate of the RERA, all the real estate projects are now required to be registered, if the apartments therein are constructed for the purpose of sale or otherwise. The fact that the Appellant has, therefore, registered the project also makes it necessary to infer that, the Appellant has invited upon itself the applicability of the provisions of the RERA, as Appellant is also fully aware that whatever 'Agreements' executed by it with the Respondents are in the nature of sale, though they are titled as 'Agreements of Lease'.  84. Thus, having regard to the totality of the facts and circumstances and the terms and conditions of the 'Agreements', having regard to the entire purport and object of the Act, it has to be held that, the dispute in the present case definitely falls within the jurisdiction of RERA. The interplay of all the provisions contained in the Act, coupled with the real purport of the 'Agreement of Lease', leads to no other inference, but to 55  hold that, the complaints filed by the Respondents before the 'Adjudicating Officer', under Section 18 of the Act, are definitely maintainable and the 'Adjudicating Officer' is having the jurisdiction to entertain and decide those complaints. The mechanical interpretation given by the 'Adjudicating Officer' to the provisions of the Act, merely focusing on the nomenclature of the 'Agreement', was clearly defeating the object of the Act and hence, it was rightly set aside by the Appellate Tribunal.  85. These Second Appeals, therefore, hold no merits; hence, stand dismissed.  86. In view thereof, the Civil Applications pending therein do not survive and the same are disposed of as infructuous. [DR.

This is one more case where the Developers despite collecting an approximate amount of Rs.178 Crores from the innocent flat purchasers, have not provided to them a single flat till date. Though the tenants have obtained Recovery Certificates from the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority, Mumbai (' ) for refund of the sale consideration, due to delay of several years in constructing their flats, the developers have the temerity to state before this Court by themselves and also through their Advocates that \"We have nothing to offer to the flat purchasers.\". In any event in view of the completely dishonest conduct of the developers, we cannot trust any of their subsequent statements/promises/ undertakings given to the Court and we proceed to pass an interim order in the above proceedings.  2. As the above Writ Petitions arise out of common set of facts and seek similar reliefs, we considered it desirable to hear all these Petitions together.  3. By the above Writ Petitions, the Petitioners have prayed for a writ in the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate writ or a direction against the Collector, Mumbai and the Tahsildar, Mumbai respectively, mandating them to comply with and execute the Recovery Certificates issued by the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority, Mumbai  ) against the Developer - M/s. Reliance Enterprise and in favour of the Petitioners. The Petitioners in the above Writ Petitions have also 5  sought ad-interim/interim reliefs against the Developer, which reliefs are sought in aid of the final reliefs.  4. Admit.  5. By this common Order, we will consider whether the Petitioners are entitled to the interim reliefs as sought in the above Writ Petitions.  6. Apart from considering whether the Petitioners are entitled to interim reliefs against the Developer, as sought in the above Petitions, we will also consider whether the partners of M/s. Reliance Enterprise   Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara and Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara have wilfully breached and disobeyed the orders of disclosure and injunction passed by this Court and have thereby interfered with the administration of justice, necessitating an action by this Court under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971   against Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara and Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara.    7. The Petitioners in the above Writ Petitions are 'allottees' as defined under Section 2(d) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016     who have purchased flats in a project known as  being developed by M/s. Reliance Enterprise  under registered Agreements for Sale. As the Developer failed to handover possession of their flats 6  within the stipulated time, the Petitioners filed Complaints   under Section 18 of the said Act before RERA. RERA allowed these Complaints and directed the Developer to refund the amounts received by them from these Petitioners, within 30 days from the date of the Order. However, the Developer failed to comply with the said Orders. Infact in Writ Petition (L) No. 28699 of 2021, the Developer even filed an Appeal before the Appellate Authority which was later withdrawn by the Developer subject to a cost of Rs. 1 lakh to be paid by the Developer.  7.1 Since the Developer failed to comply with the aforesaid Orders passed by RERA, the Petitioners were constrained to file execution proceedings before RERA. The execution proceedings were allowed and RERA issued a Recovery Certificate under Section 40(1) of the said Act read with Rule 3 of the Maharashtra Real Estate (Regulation and Development) (Recovery of Interest, Penalty, Compensation, Fine Payable, Forms of Complaints and Appeal, etc.), Rules, 2016   in favour of the Petitioners and against the Developer  7.2 The particulars of the Recovery Certificates issued in favour of the Petitioners are as under:  i A Recovery Certificate dated 5 May 2021 has been issued in favour of Petitioners in Writ Petition No. 444 of 2022.  ii A Recovery Certificate dated 6 September 2019 has been issued in favour of Petitioner in Writ Petition (L) No. 28699 of 2021 7  iii A Recovery Certificate dated 1 August 2018 has been issued in favour of Petitioners in Writ Petition (L) No. 29063 of 2021.  7.3 RERA then forwarded these Recovery Certificates to the Collector and Tahsildar directing them to execute the same and recover the decreetal amounts as mentioned therein (which were payable to the Petitioners), as arrears of land revenue.  7.4 However, the Petitioners state that despite repeated reminders, the Collector and Tahsildar, have failed to execute or take any effective steps to execute the said Recovery Certificates till date. It is being aggrieved by this inaction of the Collector and Tahsildar in complying with their statutory duties, that the Petitioners have filed the above Writ Petitions.  7.5 In aid of the aforestated final relief that is sought against the Collector and Tahsildar, the Petitioners, in the above Writ Petitions, also seek interim reliefs against the Developer and persons claiming through or under them, so that the decreetal amounts to be paid to the Petitioners under their respective Recovery Certificates are protected till such time as the statutory authorities secure the recovery of the same as arrears of land revenue.      8. Before considering the grant of interim reliefs to the Petitioners, it is necessary to set out certain orders that have been passed by this Court and the events 8  that transpired during the hearing of the above Writ Petitions:  8.1 On 29 November 2021 when Writ Petition No.444 of 2022 came up for hearing, upon being   satisfied that the partners of M/s. Reliance Enterprise   Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara had cheated the Petitioners, we directed Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara to remain present before us on 2 December 2021 at 2.30 p.m.  8.2 On 2 December 2021, only Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara remained present before us and stated that his brother was advised rest at home and was unfit to work. In support thereof, a medical certificate dated 1 December 2021, issued by a doctor from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital and Medical Research Institute, was also produced. The said medical certificate only mentioned about certain surgeries performed on Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara but did not mention when these surgeries were performed or the present medical problems being faced by Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara. We then enquired regarding the same from Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara, who stated that the said surgeries had been performed two years back and thereafter undertook to keep Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara present before this Court on 3 December at 2.30 p.m. The said statement was accepted. Further, we also directed the Mapara Brothers to file their affidavits of disclosure setting out   their movable and immovable assets both encumbered as well as unencumbered, income tax returns, bank account statements, etc. Accordingly, this Court   Order 9  dated 3 December 2021 directed as under:  \"8.                 9. Stand over to 3rd December, 2021 at 2.30 p.m.\"  (Emphasis Supplied)  8.3 On 3 December 2021, both, Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara, remained present before this Court. We must note here that the presence of Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara at this hearing itself showed that the medical certificate produced on the previous day was only an attempt to avoid complying with the previous order passed by this Court.  8.4 During the hearing, Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara produced few income tax returns and statements. Upon perusing the said income tax returns and statements we   found that there were several partnership firms in which the Mapara Brothers were partners; there were quite a few projects that they have undertaken; they had received approx. Rs.175 Crores from the flat purchasers in the 'Hill View' Project; they have given huge loans to their immediate family members, however they have informed this Court that they have nothing to offer to the Petitioners in compliance of the Orders passed by RERA in favour of the Petitioners and against them. We were also informed by the Advocate for 10  the Petitioner that more than 200 purchasers had paid monies to the Mapara Brothers towards flats in the 'Hill View' Project but the Mapara Brothers had cheated them all by only constructing a shell structure till date and in the last 7 years. We were also informed that many of these purchasers had invested their life savings and many had even taken loans for purchase of these flats, which they continue to service despite no flat/s being handed over to them by the Developer.  8.5 At this hearing, Advocate appearing for Ragini Kamal Choksi, another flat purchase in the 'Hill View' project, informed this Court that even his client had been cheated by the Mapara Brothers, who have failed to comply with the orders of RERA and the Appellate Authority passed in her favour.  8.6 Thereafter, the Mapara Brothers sought time to file an Affidavit of Disclosure, as directed by this Court   its Order dated 2 December 2021, on or before 10 December 2021. Meanwhile, the Mapara Brothers also undertook that none of the partners of their partnership firm/s/companies in which any of the Mapara Brothers are partners and/or their immediate family members are partners, will not operate the bank accounts of the partnership firms until 10 December 2021 without seeking prior permission of this Court. The said undertaking was accepted by this Court. In view thereof, this Court by its Order dated 3 December 2021 directed as under:  \"7. Shri Hemandra Haridas Mapara and his brother Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara seek time to file an Affidavit and place the particulars / 11  disclosure as directed by this Court by its Order dated 2nd December, 2021, on or before 10th December, 2021. Since Shri Hemandra Haridas Mapara is not before this Court for the first time and was joined as Defendant by other flat purchasers who had earlier filed Suit/s against him in this Court,       i Shri Hemandra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara shall file their respective Affidavit/s of disclosure providing all particulars as directed by this Court in the Order dated 2nd December, 2021.  ii Shri Hemandra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara shall in addition thereto disclose the following:  a Particulars of all the partnership firm/s / Companies in which they and/or their immediate family members are partners.  b Income-tax returns of the last five years of all the partnership firm/s in which they and/or their immediate family members are partners.  c Bank accounts of the last five years of all the immediate family members standing in their single and/or joint names.                                      vi Shri Hemandra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas 12  Mapara and their immediate family members shall not sell, alienate, encumber, part with possession and/or create third party rights in respect of any of their assets or the assets of any of the firm/s / companies in which they are partners/directors and shall not create any further liabilities with regard to any of their personal assets and/or assets of their immediate family members and/or assets of the firm/s / companies in which they are partners/directors.  vii Shri Hemandra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara and their immediate family members as well as the partners/directors of the firm/s /Companies in which they are partners/directors, shall not sell, alienate, encumber, part with possession and/or create third party rights in respect of the unsold flats in any of the projects undertaken by them. viii Shri Hemandra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara shall not leave the country without seeking prior permission of this Court.  Stand over to 10th December, 2021, FOB.\"  (Emphasis Supplied)  8.7 On 10 December 2021, Ms. Tansin Monis, Advocate appearing for the Developer and the Mapara Brothers, informed this Court that the Mapara Brothers had, admittedly, not complied with the Orders dated 2 and 3 December 2021 as the Mapara Brothers had filed an application seeking recall of these Orders. Further an adjournment was sought by her stating that Advocate Rakesh Pandey who was the arguing counsel was before another court at Andheri. The matter was kept back at her request. Despite the same, Advocate Rakesh Pandey failed to remain present. She thereafter insisted that we take on record her written notes of arguments to decide the matter. We refused to do so and observed that we were not willing to decide such 13  matters on the basis of written notes of arguments because the   of the Developer and his Advocates appeared to be to avoid answering any questions put to them and/or their Clients by this Court pertaining to the above matters. However, as a last chance and only by way of indulgence, we adjourned the matters to 15 December 2021, High on Board.  8.8 On 15 December 2021, the above Writ Petitions could not be heard as this Court was not available.  8.9 The above Writ Petitions were then listed on 5 January 2022 when Shri Sharan Jagtiani, appearing for the Petitioners in Writ Petition No. 444 of 2022 informed us that the Developer had not filed any affidavit of disclosure and had once again failed to comply with the Orders dated 2 and 3 December 2021 passed by this Court. Advocate Monis, appearing for the Developer, informed us that a Compilation of Documents provided by the Developer has been prepared and is ready for being filed in court and the same would be in compliance of the Orders dated 2 and 3  December 2021. Thus, based on this representation made on behalf of the Developer, we gave one more opportunity to the Developer to fully comply with our Orders dated 2 and 3 December 2021 and directed Advocate Monis to place the said Compilation of Documents on record. The Compilation of Documents was then forwarded to the Court through the Court Associate and Advocate Monis undertook to serve a copy of the same on the Advocate for the Petitioners in Writ Petition No. 444 of 2022 by 4.00 14  p.m. The said statement was accepted, and this Court passed the following Order dated 5 January 2022:  \"2. The Learned Advocate representing the developers has thereafter forwarded the compilation/s of documents to the Court through the Court Associate. She states that a soft copy of the compilation shall be forwarded today by 4.00 p.m. to the Advocates for the Petitioners.     3. We have noted that the Orders dated 2nd and 3rd December, 2021 have not been fully complied with by the Respondent No.4.             (Emphasis Supplied)  8.10 On 13 January 2022, Shri Jagtiani, Learned Senior Advocate informed this Court that the disclosures submitted by the Developer on the previous date were incomplete and not in compliance with the Orders dated 2 and 3 December passed by this Court. In support of his submission, Shri Jagtiani tendered a Note containing a table setting out the disclosures required as per the Orders dated 2 and 3 December 2021 and the status of its compliance/non-compliance by the Developer. As per the said Note, it could be seen that the Developer had   not disclosed (i) the movable assets of the Mapara Brothers; (ii) Income Tax Returns of various partnership firms of the Mapara Brothers (iii) Statements of bank accounts held by the Mapara Brothers, either in single name as well as joint (iv) particulars of all other projects being developed by the Mapara Brothers, sold and unsold units therein and 15  amounts to be received therefrom (v) partnership firms/companies where family members of Mapara Brothers are partners/directors, etc. Further, it was also pointed out that the Disclosures were supposed to be made on Affidavit as per the Orders dated 2 and 3 December 2021, but no such Affidavit was filed by the Mapara Brothers.  8.11 Advocate Monis, appearing for the Developer stated that she will go through the Note submitted by Shri Jagtiani and make all the required disclosures on Affidavit. Further, she also stated that the Developer has already applied to the banks to provide statements of their 19 bank accounts as directed by this Court and undertook to produce the said statements before this Court immediately upon receipt of the same from the banks. The statements were    Thereafter, even though this Court was inclined to keep the matter on 24 January 2022, at the insistence of Advocate Monis the same were adjourned to 27 January 2022. Further, by this Order dated 13  January 2022, we also directed the Advocate for the Developer to forward the further disclosure affidavit to the Advocates for the Petitioners in Writ Petition No. 444 of 2022 not later than 24 January 2022.  8.12 On 27 January 2022, we were informed by Shri Jagtiani that an unaffirmed Affidavit dated 26 January 2021 had been filed by Shri Hemendra Mapara on behalf of the Developer. Having given enough opportunities to the 16  Developer/Mapara Brothers to fully comply with the Orders of this Court, we expected that the Developer/Mapara Brothers would now come out clean and make true and full disclosures. However, we were informed by Shri Jagtiani, that upon perusing the Affidavit in Reply filed by the Developer alongwith the documents, they have infact observed that not only has the Developer once again failed in fully complying with the orders of disclosure dated 2 and 3 December but the Developer has also breached the injunction Order dated 3 December 2021 passed by this Court, by withdrawing large sum of monies from their bank accounts. In view thereof, by our Order dated 27 January 2022, we directed the Mapara Brothers to remain present before this Court on 31 January 2022 through video conferencing.  8.13 On 31 January 2022, Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara was present before this Court through video conferencing. Shri Jagtiani tendered a Compilation of Documents containing (i) bank statements to show that the Developer had withdrawn monies to the tune of Rs. 56 lakhs from their bank accounts and/or transferred the same to third parties (including a large sum of Rs. 17 lakhs approximately to one, M/s. J V Enterprises), in breach of the injunction order contained in Order dated 3   December 2021 passed by this Court (ii) bank statements for the period 1 April 2019 to 31 January 2020 of the Developer to show diversion of funds from the escrow accounts of 'Hill View' to personal accounts of the Mapara Brothers, their family members, related entities and M/s. J V Enterprises, to whom large sums of money had 17  been transferred and (iii) a photograph of the poster put up outside the 'Hill View' Project whereby the same entity, M/s. J V Enterprises, claimed that the said 'Hill View' Project belonged to them. Based on these documents, Shri Jagtiani submitted that it appears that M/s. J V Enterprises is a related entity of the Developer to whom large sums of monies are being transferred while the Developer continues to avoid paying the admitted dues of the innocent flat purchasers.  8.14 Shri Jagtiani also tendered another Note with a table setting out the disclosures required as per the Orders dated 2 and 3 December 2021 and the status of its compliance/non-compliance by the Developer. From the said Note, it could be seen that the Developer had once again proved false and incomplete disclosure and breached the Orders dated 2 and 3 December 2021 passed by this. In the aforesaid Affidavit, the Developer had   not disclosed (i) various other group entities   Relstruct Buildcon Limited, Relstruct Infra Limited, Relstruct, Realtors Pvt. Ltd., etc. where the Mapara Brothers and their family members are directors; (ii) income tax returns of only some of the disclosed partnership firms had been provided; (iii) Out of 30 bank account statements provided by the Developer only 5 were up to 31  December 2021 (iv) statement of receivables and list of sold and unsold units for other projects viz. Giri Niwas, Triveni, Anand Tower, Tilak Sangram, Sarva Mangal, Radhakunj.  8.15 In response, Shri Hemendra Mapara, who was present at the hearing 18  which was being conducted through video conferencing, informed this Court that M/s. J. V. Enterprises was his contractor for the 'Hill View' and 'Triveni' Project and the monies had been transferred to M/s. J V Enterprises and other third parties in view of certain 'consent terms' filed by the Developer before this Court in another proceeding. He admitted that no permission was taken by him from this Court before making these transactions after the Order dated 3 December 2021 was passed. He also stated that he did not know why the said poster was put up by M/s. J. V. Enterprises outside the project. Accordingly, we directed the Developer to place on record the said consent terms and explain each of the transfers made in breach of the injunction order. Further, we once again granted an opportunity to the Developer to fully comply with the order of disclosures. In view thereof by an Order dated 31  January 2022, this Court directed as under:                            \"7(iv) None of the partners of the partnership firm/s/Companies in which Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara and/or their immediate 19  family members are partners, will operate the bank accounts of the partnership firms without seeking prior permission of this Court.\"  2.                      .  3. In support of his submissions, Shri Jagtiani tendered a Compilation of Documents consisting of some highlighted bank statements of Respondent No.4 and its connected entities and also a photograph of a board which was put up outside the project 'Hill View' in which the Petitioners had purchased a flat from Respondent No.4. Relying upon the said Compilation of Documents, Shri Jagtiani points out as under:                                       20      (                                                    4. Shri Jagtiani further submits that the said Affidavit of Disclosure dated 26 January 2022 filed by Respondent No.4 is not in full compliance with the previous Orders dated 2 December 2021 and 3 December 2021, passed by this Court and several particulars as directed by this Court vide the said Orders have not been disclosed by Respondent No.4. In support of his submission, he tendered a Note showing non-compliances of these Orders.  5. He submits that in view thereof, following information/explanation is required to be disclosed by Respondent No.4:  (i) Nature and constitution of the said firm, M/s.J.V. Enterprises;  (ii)   is in any manner related to Respondent No.4 or its partners Shri Hemendra 21  Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara;  (iii) In what capacity and for what reason was the said board (photograph annexed at Pg.22 of the said Compilation) put up by M/s. J V Enterprises at the Project site (if it was only a mere contractor);  (iv) Nature of relationship between M/s. J. V. Enterprises and Respondent No.4, in view of which such huge amounts have been transferred to M/s. J.V. Enterprises by Respondent No.4 and its connected entities, over the years;  (v) When the Project was stalled since 2016-2017 and no work was being carried out at site, why were huge amounts transferred to M/s. J V Enterprises by Respondent No.4 and its connected entities as can be seen from Annexure 1 and 2 to the said Compilation;  (vi) Nature of transactions/transfers highlighted at Pages 5-6 of the said Compilation and explanation for not obtaining leave of this Court before making such transfers;  (vii) Reasons for not disclosing various group entities where Shri Hemendra Mapara or Shri Chetan Mapara or their family members are directors/partners (i) Relstruct Builders Pvt. Ltd., (ii) Relstruct Real Estate Pvt. Ltd. (iii) Relstruct Realtors Pvt. Ltd.; (iv) Relstruct Buildcon Ltd.; (v) Relstruct Infra Ltd.; (vi) Avanza Buildcon LLP.; (vii) Balkrishna Logistics LLP. Relstruct Builders Pvt. Ltd.; (viii) Relstruct Real Estate Pvt. Ltd., despite having been given multiple opportunities to fully comply with the orders of disclosure passed by this Court (See,Sr.No.2/Pg.6-7 of the Note tendered by the Petitioners on Status of Compliance of Order dated 2nd and 3rd December 2021 by Respondent No.4);  (viii) Reasons for not furnishing Income Tax Returns of Arihant Associates, Reliance Realtors and Adinath Enterprises (See, Sr. No.2/Pg.1-2 of the Note tendered by the Petitioners on Status of Compliance of Order dated 2nd and 3rd December 2021 by Respondent No.4);  (ix) Reasons for not providing particulars of partnership firms or companies where family members of Shri Hemendra Mapara or Shri Chetan Mapara are partners (See, Sr. No. 3/Pg.8 of the Note tendered by the Petitioners on Status of 22  Compliance of Order dated 2nd and 3rd December 2021 by Respondent No.4);  (x) Reasons for not furnishing all bank statements up to date of filing of the said Affidavit of Disclosure (See, Sr. No. 3/Pg.3 of the Note tendered by the Petitioners on Status of Compliance of Order dated 2 and 3rd December 2021 by Respondent No.4);  (xi) Reasons for not providing Statement of Receivables from sold and unsold units in the projects owned by Respondent No.4 and/or its group entities (See,Sr. No. 4/Pg.4-5 of the Note tendered by the Petitioners on Status of Compliance of Order dated 2nd and 3rd December 2021 by Respondent No.4);  (xii) Whether Shri Hemandra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara have opened a fresh bank account in a nationalized bank and whether all amount/s received by them and/or by their immediate family members, from any of the flat purchasers and/or their debtors are being deposited in the said account, as directed under para 7(v) of the Order dated 3 December 2021(See, Sr. No. 7/Pg.11 of the Note tendered by the Petitioners on Status of Compliance of Order dated 2 and 3 December 2021 by Respondent No.4);                8. Stand over to 9th February, 2022.\"  (Emphasis Supplied)  8.16 On 9 February 2022, we were informed that an Affidavit dated 9   February 2022 had been served by Shri Hemendra Mapara on behalf of the Developer. Shri Jagtiani pointed out from the said Affidavit that the consent terms referred to by the Developer on the previous date have been executed between one, Triveni CHSL 23  and the Developer and M/s. J V Enterprises is not a party to the same and despite that, huge amounts were transferred to M/s. J V Enterprises in breach of the Order dated 3 December 2021. Further, Shri Hemendra Mapara who had initially refused to recognise the board put up outside the 'Hill View' Project now stated that the said board was put up by M/s J. V. Enterprises in view of certain disputes between the Developer and M/s. J V Enterprises as the Developer had not made certain payments to M/s. J V Enterprises, which created trust issues. In view thereof, M/s. J V Enterprises put its board so that no third party denies its rights to receive the amount from the Developer. It is also relevant and interesting to note the explanation provided by the Developer to the Petitioner allegation that large sums of monies were paid to M/s. J V Enterprises in 2018-2020 even though the project was stalled since 2016- 2017. The Developer has stated that      If no slabs were being casted during this period, there was no conceivable reasons for the Developer to have paid large sums of monies to M/s. J V Enterprises during this period.  8.17 Shri Jagtiani therefore submitted that the Mapara Brothers and their family members were guilty of committing contempt of the Orders passed by this Court. In view of what transpired at the hearing we thought it necessary to direct Shri 24  Narayan Kohli to remain present to explain the transactions under which he had received large sums of money, before issuing notice seeking explanation from the Mapara Brothers for brazenly violating the orders passed by this Court. Accordingly, by our Order dated 9 February 2022 we directed as under:  \"2.               we are deferring issuance of such notices upto 17th February, 2022. Advocate Ms. Tamsin Monis also states that since Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara, partner of Respondent No.4 is not keeping good health, he shall appear before the Court through video-conference       3. Stand over to 17th February, 2022.\"  (Emphasis Supplied)  8.18 On 17 February 2022, when the matter was called out Shri Hemendra Mapara informed this Court that he had informed Shri Narayan Kohli to remain present, however, it seemed that he was not present. We then directed Shri Hemendra Mapara to call and inform Shri Narayan Kohli to remain present before this Court at  2.30 p.m. Thereafter, Shri Narayan Kohli appeared before us at 2.30 p.m. and upon this Court enquiring the reason for him not remaining present in the morning session informed us that he was not aware of the previous order passed by this Court and only learnt of it in the morning. This once again shows that Shri Hemendra Mapara had 25  made an incorrect statement before this Court in the morning session. Shri Kohli informed this Court that he had been involved in construction of 'Hill View' Project since 2018 under a Work Order issued by the Developer. Further, he also informed that construction has completely stopped since the last 18 months and no attempt is made to recommence the construction for the last one year.  8.19 Further, with respect to the board put up by M/s. J. V. Enterprises outside the 'Hill View' Project, he stated that the contents of this Board were prepared by his representative Shri Paresh Katchhy who is a 'broker' and whose mobile number '9867359063' also appears on the said Board. Further, when we enquired as to what was meant by the statement        , Shri Kohli who claims to be the Sole Proprietor of M/s. J V Enterprises, was unable to provide any answers.  8.20 Shri Jagtiani, then pointed out to us that the statement made by Shri Kohli is false and incorrect to his knowledge since Shri Paresh Katchhy is the Finance Director of the Relstruct Group where Shri Hemendra Mapara or Shri Chetan Mapara or their family members are Directors/Partners. It is also relevant to note here that despite the contact number on the board being that of Shri Paresh Katchhy, who was a Director in one of the group entities of the Developer, Shri Hemendra Mapara had 26  falsely stated on 31 January 2022 that he was no aware by whom the board had been put up. Shri Jagtiani also informed us that the accounts produced by the Developers shows that the Developer has paid marketing charges / costs including brokerage to the tune of Rs. 34 Crores. Since different statements at different times were being made by the Developers, to ascertain the true and correct facts in the above matter, we by our Order dated 17 February 2022, directed Shri Paresh Katchhy to remain present before this Court on 24 February 2022. By this we also directed as under: Stand over to 24th February, 2022 when the Developers shall provide a compilation comprising of copies of all the agreements executed (registered/unregistered) by the Developers with the flat purchasers qua the Hill View Project.        8.21 On 24 February 2022, Shri Paresh Katchhy informed us that he was initially acting as a broker for the Developer in the 'Hill View' Project but later at the Developers' insistence he was made a Director of the Relstruct Group. This shows that Shri Hemendra Mapara was always aware by whom the said Board had been put up but deliberately suppressed the same from this Court. Further, at the said hearing, Shri Jagtiani pointed out to us that from the monies collected from the flat purchasers, huge amounts had been transferred to entities which have nothing to do with the construction of 'Hill View' Project. For example, an amount of Rs. 1,75,00,000/- approximately had been transferred to an entity called Parshwanath Trading Co. which 27  is engaged in the business of manufacturing of kids wear and toys during the period from 2013 to 2021. Further, an amount of Rs. 53,39,000/- had been transferred to an entity called Darshil Enterprises which is engaged in the business of clothing/fabric. An amount of Rs. 24,49,579/- had been utilised for taking health insurance for Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Darshan Hemendra Mapara from Religare Finvest Ltd. The Developer also filed an Affidavit setting out the breakup of Rs. 34 crores spent towards marketing. The breakup mentioned therein shows that the entire amount has not been utilised towards marketing expenses but monies have been used for other purposes.  8.22 Pursuant thereto, the Developer informed us that they would pay the dues of the Petitioners but sought time to work out the modalities. In view of this request the matter was listed on 2 Mach 2022 and 3 March 2022. However, on 3  March 2022 we were informed that the Developer is now not willing to settle with the above Petitioners.    9. Upon hearing the parties and considering the material on record, we are   satisfied that despite the directions from RERA, the Collector and Tahsildar have failed to exercise their powers under Section 263 to 267 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 read with Rule 17 of the Maharashtra 28  Realization of Land Revenue Rules, 1967 to secure the recovery of the decretal amounts mentioned under the Recovery Certificates, which are payable to the Petitioners.  9.1 In  which arose out of similar set of facts, this Court held that in exercise of its inherent and wide powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, this Court has the jurisdiction to pass orders and/or directions against a private person if such reliefs are in aid of the final relief. Further, it was also held that it is within the extraordinary and inherent jurisdiction of this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to protect the rights and interests of the Petitioners by granting interim reliefs even against a private party Respondent, that has wrongly benefitted from the inaction on the part of the public authorities in discharge of their public duty.  9.2 In the present case, we have no hesitation in holding that the only person who has wrongly benefitted from such inaction of the Collector and Tahsildar are the Developer herein (being a private party), who have till date failed to comply with the Orders passed by RERA and failed to pay the decreetal amount to the Petitioners, which amounts are admittedly due and payable by the Developer to the Petitioners.  9.3 As per the documents produced by the Developer themselves, they have collected approximately Rs. 178 crores from flat purchasers of the 'Hill View' Project. Despite having received such huge amounts from the flat purchasers, the Developers  Bom 1 090 29  have till date not completed construction of the 'Hill View' Project and has infact abandoned the same for the last one year. Further, from the material on record, it also appears that out of the monies collected from the flat purchasers, huge amounts have been transferred by the partners of the Developers to themselves, their family members and even related entities while the innocent flat purchasers still await their dream homes or the refund of their hard-earned money. Infact, in teeth of the order of injunction passed by this Court in the above Writ Petitions, the Developer has transferred monies to the tune of Rs. 56 lakhs inter alia to itself and related parties, in complete disregard to the orders passed by this Court.  9.4 Considering the aforesaid conduct of the Developers, we are of the view that the Developer has no intention of voluntarily repaying the admitted dues of the Petitioners and that the Petitioners are justified in their apprehension that if interim reliefs to protect the decreetal amounts of the Petitioners are not granted, it is very likely that the Developer shall deal with or further encumber all their assets and nothing will be left to the hands of the Petitioners despite having a decree in their favour. Accordingly, we are of the view that the Petitioners have made out a case for grant of interim reliefs and the balance of convenience is in favour of the Petitioners and against the Developer.  9.5 Further, from the events set out hereinabove, it is also clear that not only has the Developer failed to comply with the Orders passed by RERA but has also 30  brazenly violated various orders of disclosure passed by this Court. Despite this Court having given a long rope to the Developer to provide a true and complete disclosure of its assets in terms of the Order dated 2 and 3 December 2021, which were clear and ambiguous, the Developer has till date not fully complied with the said Order.  9.6 We must note that at each hearing false and insufficient disclosures were made by the Developer, with an intent to mislead this Court. Further, the     of the Developer was to suppress material information and only disclose the same if and when such non-compliance was pointed out by the Advocates for the Petitioners. Such conduct is unacceptable. As held by this Court in    , the determination of whether a disclosure is sufficient or not, is not to be made by the party who is ordered to make such disclosures by the Court - when the terms of the Order seeking disclosure are clear and ambiguous. We must also note here that on multiple occasions undertakings were given by the Developer that the affidavits of disclosure filed by it are in full compliance of the Orders dated 2  and 3  December 2021, which undertakings were accepted by this Court. However, we hold that the Developer has willfully and deliberately breached these undertakings which shows that the Developer has no regards for the orders passed by this Court.  9.7 In addition to the breach of the Orders of disclosure, the Developer has also breached the undertaking given by the Developer that the Developer and its family members shall not operate their bank accounts till further orders of the Court, 31  as contained in the Order dated 3 December 2021. The Developer in breach of this Order transferred approximately Rs. 56 lakhs to itself, its related entities and other third parties without seeking any permission from this Court. The only explanation provided by Shri Hemendra Mapara on behalf of the Developer for not seeking such permission is that it  . We cannot accept such an explanation.  9.8 In our view, such brazen and continuous disregard for orders of the Court including by making false and misleading statements would amount to a willful and deliberate breach, obstruction and interference with the administration of justice entitling this Court to take suo-moto action in contempt against the partners of the Developer   Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Chetan Haridas Mapara.  9.9 An Order of injunction alone would not be sufficient in the facts and circumstances of the present case where the Petitioners have Recovery Certificates and the statutory authorities are unable or unwilling to proceed towards making any recovery. As we have noticed in Rustam Mehta (supra) developers such as this Developer carry on businesses through special purpose vehicles all forming part of the same group or economic unit. Even though innocent flat purchasers are left stranded with no sight of the monies admittedly due to them, the developer or the group continue to engage in high value real estate projects with there being no impact on their lives or business. This shakes the confidence of the ordinary citizens especially when there is no recovery being made by the statutory authorities who are supposed to 32  act for their benefit. In these circumstances the Courts will have to in exercise of their extraordinary writ jurisdiction attempt to pass effective interim orders. Keeping this in mind and having already directed the Developer to open a separate bank account with a nationalised bank for all receivables and revenues, some provision will have to be made for the actual recoveries to be realised by the Petitioners. In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case such orders are entirely justified and would alone further the interest of justice.  10. In view of our foresaid findings, we pass the following order:  (i) The Developer is directed to forthwith disclose the particulars of the bank account opened by it with a nationalised bank  , pursuant to our Order dated 3 December 2021;  (ii) The Developer shall continue to deposit all amount/s received by them and/or by their immediate family members, from any of the flat purchasers in respect of any of its projects including 'Hill View' and 'Triveni and/or from their debtors in the said Designated Account, until further orders of this Court;  (iii) The Court Receiver, High Court, Bombay is appointed as Receiver in respect of the Designated Account with all powers under Order XL of Code of Civil Procedure Code, 1908;  (iv) On 1 day of every month, the Court Receiver is directed to transfer 30% of the total credits lying in the Designated Account to a bank account to be opened by 33  the Prothonotary and Sr Master, High Court, Bombay with a nationalised bank.  (v) Upon deposit of the 30% of all credits from the Designated Account to a bank account opened by the Prothonotary and Sr Master, High Court, Bombay, the Petitioners on 5 day of every month shall be entitled to withdraw monies in the following proportion:  Petitioners in Writ Petition No. 444 of 2021:   Petitioner in Writ Petition (L) No. 28699 of 2021:   Petitioners in Writ Petition (L) No. 20963 of 2021:   (vi) The amounts withdrawn by the Petitioners in the manner as aforestated shall be adjusted by it towards the decreetal amount, till the entire decreetal amount of the Petitioners is satisfied. It is made clear that the amounts so withdrawn shall be first adjusted against the interest amount and thereafter towards the principal amount payable to the Petitioners;  (vii) A statement of balance decreetal amount payable to each Petitioners after adjusting the amounts withdrawn by them in the aforesaid manner shall be provided to the Prothonotary and Sr Master, High Court, Bombay by the Petitioners on or before 5 of every month;  (viii) Till the entire decreetal amounts of the Petitioners are paid, the Developer, its partners Mr. Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Mr. Chetan Haridas Mapara including their family members and their group entities shall continue to be 34  restrained and bound by our Orders dated 2 December 2021 and 3 December 2021;  (ix) A Notice under Section 14 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 read with Rule 1031 of the Original Side Rules, 1960 shall be issued by the Original Side Registry of the Bombay High Court, to the partners of the Developer viz. Shri Hemendra Haridas Mapara and Shri Chetan Haridas Mapara calling upon them to respond as to why they should not be punished under the aforesaid provisions for obstruction and interference with the administration of justice and for lowering the dignity of this Court;  11. We would also like to clarify here that for the purpose of calculating the proportion of each of the Petitioners, as more particularly specified in paragraph 9(v) above, we have only considered the principal amount payable to each of the Petitioners (excluding the amounts paid towards stamp duty, registration charges, VAT, costs, etc.)  12. The application for interim reliefs is accordingly allowed in the aforesaid terms. Parties shall be at liberty to apply.  13. Costs will be considered at the stage of final disposal of the above Writ Petitions.   35"},

The first question arises whether the Heartbeat City Projects are of Amrapali Group, and the second question is as to the agreement entered into by M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited with M/s.Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited.   It is apparent that Heartbeat City Projects were launched in the name of the 'Amrapali Heartbeat' project in 2011-2012 with Mr. M. S. Dhoni, the Brand Ambassador. The Home Buyers' agreement was entered into in the name style of Amrapali Group with the assurance that flats will be delivered within 36 months. Most of the buyers paid their dues on time, but the construction was delayed.   Heartbeat City Projects comprise Heartbeat City 1 (for short, HBC 1) and Heartbeat City 2 (for short, HBC 2) and Hanging Gardens in Noida. 2  The land for the respective projects was allotted in the name of Three Platinum Softech Private Limited, Pebbles Prolease Private Limited, and Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited. The projects were launched and advertised in the name of the Amrapali Group. Phase 3 project was started in 2011-2012 in the name of Hanging Garden; however, later on, Hanging Garden project was scrapped, and the home buyers were admittedly shifted to HBC 1 and HBC 2 or refunded the amount.   HBC 1 comprises 759 units, and HBC 2 consists of 1217 units + shops, but construction could not progress for one reason or the other.   In the Audit Report, it has been found that the land in Baseline was part and parcel of HBC 1 and HBC 2 projects and in general, under the control of the Directors of HBC 1 and HBC 2 and was purchased from the funds of the customers of HBC 1 and HBC 2 and, is an integral part of HBC 1 and HBC 2 and, therefore, customers of HBC 1 and HBC 2 have the first and the full right over the land rights and on the proceeds to be received from the sale of the land can be utilised for the construction of HBC 1 and HBC 2 projects. HBC 1 has nine towers and 785 units, of which, 675 units were sold and Rs. 147 crores recoverable from sold units. HBC 2 has 12 towers and 1282 units, out of which, 936 units were sold and Rs. 301 crores recoverable from sold units. The cost to complete HBC 1 is approximately Rs. 167.19 crores and HBC 2 is Rs. 375.64 crores, which is recoverable from unsold units.   Mr. Amit Wadhwa, Director of Amrapali Homes, has 25% shareholding. Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha, who is the Director of Bihariji 3  Ispat Udyog Ltd. and JST Engineering Services Limited, has 13% and 12% shareholding respectively, total 25%. Mr. Vaibhav Jain and Mr. Pankaj Jain, Directors, are holding 10% and 15%, total 25% of the shareholding, whereas Cozi Habitat Builders Private Limited, Maa Sharda Holding Private Limited, through its Director Mr. Sankalp Shukla is also holding 25% shares. Similarly, in HBC Phase II, the shareholding pattern is similar to 25% of the group mentioned above of Mr. Amit Wadhwa, Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha Vaibhav Jain, Mr. Pankaj Jain, and Mr. Sankalp Shukla.   In Baseline Infradevelopers Pvt. Ltd., it is stated that shareholding of Mr. Amresh Kumar is 8.25%, Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited through Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha is 8.25%, B2C Realtors Pvt. Ltd. through Mr. Vaibhav Jain and Ms. Swati Jain is 8.25%, Cozy Habitat Builders Pvt. Ltd. through Mr. Sankalp Shukla is 8.25%. Mr. Nishant Choubey and Mr. Santosh Choubey are holding 34% and 33% respectively. Mr. Nishant Choubey and Mr. Santosh Choubey did not provide documents to the Forensic Auditors; however, they possess 67% shares.   The following findings were recorded concerning Heartbeat City in our Judgment and Order dated 23.7.2019:-                       4                   Mr. Vaibhav Jain admittedly was the architect of Amrapali Group who was holding 25% shares. Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha was also holding 25% shares in each of the projects.   Concerning Surekha Group, in our Judgment and Order dated 23.7.2019, the following facts have been mentioned :-    Amrapali and Sureka's have a very long and intricate association starting officially with the partnership venture 'Amrapali Homes' in 2006 wherein Ultra Home Construction Private Limited and Mauria Udyog Limited is partner and developed project in name of Amrapali Homes in Indirapuram then Amrapali Grand wherein Ultra Home Construction Private Limited and Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited were partners, though the land was allotted to Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited. Initially Amrapali Group ventured like these types of association as he was independently not able to meet the net worth, turnover and other eligibility criteria for land allotment by Noida authorities. They then next associated in Sapphire Project wherein Sureka's family participated as shareholders and directors in the Company. Every Joint Venture used to have an unexecuted profit sharing and investment arrangement. Since the company didn't declared dividend ever, the profits were drawn by Sureka family in the nature of advances which has majorly been squared off against billing from Mauria Udyog Limited, Jotindra Steel and their other related companies. Some of the amount is still lying as advance in the books of accounts of Amrapali Group. In 2012 Amrapali Group invested in 25% stake in Sureka family's three projects Heart Beat City, Pebbles Prolease, Three Platinum Softech. Apart from subscribing to share capital, the further investment was made directly as advance or billing from Amrapali Group to these companies and some through shell companies as well.  Further they did a project in Ultra Home Construction Private Limited with Mozambique. This project was planned, coordinated and managed by Mr Navneet Sureka in the name of Ultra Home Construction Private Limited and whatever advance was sanctioned and disbursed by the Government of Mozambique through EXIM bank to Ultra Home Construction Private Limited was eventually diverted to Sureka family through billing from Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited, Mauria Udyog 5  Limited, etc. A separate bank account of Ultra Home Construction Private Limited was opened in State Bank of Patiala, Faridabad branch where signatory was Mr Akhil Sureka who used to operate the account from there. The entire transactions of LC and EXIM bank was routed from that account. Navneet Sureka visited more in the period of contract finalization to Mozambique  Partner in the following projects:  • Amrapali Sapphire Developers Pvt. Ltd. - 10.52% of shareholding BihariJi Ispat Udyog Limited  • Amrapali Smart City Pvt Ltd - 10% shareholding held by Mauria Udyog Ltd  • Amrapali Homes - 5% - Mauria Udyog Ltd (Rs.20 crore given as an advance before 2008 and is recoverable)  • Amrapali grand - 10% BihariJi Ispat Udyog Limited -We were informed that the land was allotted in the name of Bihariji Ispat Udyog Ltd and construction and development work was done by Amrapali group.  Directors in the following companies  • Amrapali Leisure Valley Pvt Ltd - Akhil Sureka Cheque signatories in the following companies  • Amrapali Leisure Valley Pvt Ltd  • Amrapali Dream Valley Pvt Ltd  • Amrapali Leisure Valley Developers pvt Ltd  • Amrapali centurian Park Pvt Ltd From the above, it is clear that Sureka group directors namely Vishnu Sureka, Navneet Sureka and Akhil sureka were promoters in amrapali group. They were in equal control of affairs with other promoters (Anil Sharma Shiv Priya, etc.). They not only invested as a promoter heavy amount but also provided the land allotted to Bihariji Ispat a sureka group company. But the amount invested was withdrawn in a very short period by other associate companies in the form of interest, supplies, provision of services etc. it was found out that there were many other suppliers who never interacted with any of the directors/staff but supplied material to Amrapali through Akhil and Navneet Sureka. In our opinion, this was nothing but accommodation bills and a form of withdrawing funds from the group. None of the employess/ directors of the sureka companies knew that Sureka group has supplied ,material to Amrapali group. Though sureka group has a policy and procedure wthat for any item above Rs,. 5,000/- a purchase order would be issued but it was not followed in the case of supplies to Amrapali. Surprising all the transactions worth more than 500 crore has been handled single handedly by Navneet and akhil sureka without involving any of the directors and employees. All the cheques were also signed by Usreka family and not by any other directors.  It is pertinent to note that the amount paid for FSI purchased by Suraka group companies was taken back on the same day by routing through a number of companies.All such cheques for money laundering were signed by Akhil Sureka Furthermore, it is found that the amount so paid ie Rs. 80 crore was also received from suppliers of the Amrapali group. 6  Therefore in our opinion,not only FSi should be canceled but the amount os Rs. 80 crore is recovereable from them. They adopted the same methodoly. Formed various business entities, appointed small time employees the directors in these companies and routed funds of 100s of crores and it may be in the range of 1000s crores.. None of the directors were knowing about any of the business transactions. Further more most of the directors never attended any board meetings,knew about nature of business the company does, name of other directors in the company and so on. We are not sure who was teacing the fraudlent practices to whom, whether Sureka to Amrapali or vice versa.  It was observed Rs.13.44 crore paid to Sureka Public Charitable Trust were transferred to donation account subsequently. It is submitted that Sureka Public Charitable Trust is a group institution of Jotindra Steels & Tubes Limited, which is also under the forensic audit. This should be recovered from the Jotindra Steels & Tubes Limited. Sureka group used several companies to route funds from Amrapali group to Sureka group, an example being in the case of Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, where the company received Rs.3.23 crore from \"Synergy Freightways Private Limited\" from 26th March 2015 to 30th March 2015. On 31st March 2015 an amount to Rs.4.18 crore was paid to the said party through 16 separate transactions and thereby leading to a debit balance recoverable from the party amounting to Rs.0.9,5 crore as on 31st March 2015. This amount should be recovered from the Sureka Group.  It is worthwhile to mention here that M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited is an associate Company of M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited. Further, there are no business transactions with the said party except routing of funds.  Another example being in the case of Shriv Buildmat Private Limited where one of the directors is common with MauriaUdyog Limited. On scrutiny of ledger accounts of Shriv Buildmat, it was observed that during FY  -15 and 2015-16, the said company had almost 100% sales to Amrapali group of companies. It was also observed that one flat was allotted to Mr. Atul Kumar, Director of ShrivBuildmat Private Limited in Verona Heights, against the amount due to the said company. This adjustment is not genuine and the relevant amount should be recovered from Mr. Atul Kumar or his flat may be attached. As per ledger account advance to Amrapali for flat, a sum of INR 34.05 lakhs has been shown as recoverable as on 31st March, 2015. There is no name of the Company to which such advance has been given in the books of the Amrapali Group of Companies. Thus, this amount of INR 34.05 Lakhs is shown as recoverable is not genuine.  A sum of INR 53.21 Lakhs has been debited to Labour Charges Contractors on account of bill no. SBPL/Noida/010 dated 13/3/2013 has been recorded in the books of Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited on 16/03/2015.   7  During the financial year 2016-17 and 2017-18, a sum of     has been debited to this party and standing recoverable as per Raw Tally Data, till date as per details given below:    Further, there is no Name, Pan or Address available in the records of  M/s RN Traders. It was further observed that there are no business  transactions with M/s RN Traders. It is possible that this amount of     has been withdrawn by the management for their own  personal use and should be recovered from the management.  BiharijiIspat Udyog Limited being one of the partners of Amrapali Grand  always had negative capital. They withdrew much more than what they  brought into the business. There is no substance in them being called as  capital contributors to the business of Amrapali Grand. As on 1st April  2008 they had withdrawn INR 12 crore and invested a capital  contribution of INR 1.5 crore. As on 31st July 2018, they have debit  balance of INR 1.67 crore and negative capital of INR 30,380. They  always withdrew homebuyers funds for misusing for their own agendas  apart from the business.  Out of INR 12 crore given to BihariJiIspat Udyog Limited, they returned  INR 6.45 crore through bank and the balance amount was adjusted  against receivables from Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd and against  capital contribution by BiharijiIspat Udyog Ltd.  Amrapali Grand gave loans and advances to below parties, which are  recoverable as on 31 July 2018 amounting to INR 25.73 crore as per  Tally data. 8        It has been observed that amounts paid to parties above were mostly routed to Quality Synthetics Pvt Ltd which primarily belongs Sureka family. For example:  a) Payment of Rs 2,74,68,000/- has been made to Mr Ajay Kumar from 2007-08 to 2010-11 as advance recoverable. Out of this, Rs 77,00,000 was paid by him for purchase of property located at Jaypee Greens, Noida & Rs 50,00,000 was paid by him to Quality Synthetics Industries Limited.  b) Payment of Rs 10,03,55,900 has been made to Mr Anil Kumar Sharma from 2007-08 to July, 2018. Out of this, Rs 3,00,00,000 was paid to Quality Synthetics Industries Limited.  c) Payment of Rs 7,10,50,000 has been made to Mr Shiv Priya from 2007-08 to September 2010. Out of this, Rs 1,00,00,000 was paid to Quality Synthetics Industries Limited. 9  While reviewing the books of accounts of Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited and M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited, it has been observed that Amrapali Infrastructure has made purchases from M/s Jotindra Steel against Letter of Credit. The letter of credit has been discounted by M/s Jotindra Steel with the banks. The discounting charges of INR 1.30 Crores have been debited by M/s Jotindra Steel to M/s Amrapali Infrastructure. We fail to understand the reason for this treatment. In normal course of business, the supplier is the person who bears the discounting charges in respect of the transactions as the margin when sold on Letter of Credit are generally higher. This amount of     on account of discounting charges of Letter of Credit Should be recovered from M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited.  i. It has also been observed that M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited has issued service invoices for erection, shifting and transportation charges amounting to   approximately during the financial year  -15 as per details given below:        Jotindra Steels & E r ection   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r ansportation    Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  12/1/  Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  12/1/  Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  2/1/2015 Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  2/1/2015 Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  3/31/2015 Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  3/31/2015 Bill not available Tubes     Further, on scrutiny of the invoices issued by the JSTB it appears that the invoices raised for the above services are completely different from the invoices issued regularly and are prima facie non-genuine. Hence, the same should be recovered from JSTB or the Company Management as both the parties have been partnering in various projects. 10  ii. It is further observed that purchases amounting to INR 7.09 Crores, INR 59.53 Crores and INR 47.04 Crores has been made from this party in M/s Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited during the financial year 2013-14,  -15 and 2015-16 respectively. While sample checking of the purchase bills, it was noted that the goods consignment notes enclosed with the purchase bill are issued by M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited which is also a group Company of Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited. Goods consignment note enclosed with the purchase bills don't seem to be genuine in view of the undermentioned observations:  1. We sent a letter to M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited as per address on record which has been received back as undelivered.  2. Statement of Mr. Akhil Sureka, Managing Director of M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited was recorded and it was confirmed by him that most of the purchase/ sales transactions are back to back i.e. all such consignments are sent directly from their supplier to Amrapali Group of Companies. In these circumstances it is not understood by us that how the consignment notes of M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited have been enclosed with most of the purchase bills, if the transactions were back to back for their supplies.                Further, most of the purchase invoices of JST have been shown as sale on the same date with similar particulars/ quantity by raising the invoice on Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited.  We are of the view that these sales invoices raised by JST are also not genuine and are mere accommodation entries only.  Sample details of such transactions for 2 days are enclosed below:   11     It has been further observed that there have been unaccounted cash transactions between the Amrapali Group of Companies and JSTB group of Companies as per documents seized during Income Tax Search in the premises of JSTB Group of Companies which are not accounted for in the Amrapali Group of Companies. Complete Copy of the Order of CIT (Appeals) where the observations regarding unaccounted cash were discussed is enclosed herewith as     While scrutinizing the ledger of this party it was observed as follows:  a) During the month of December 2015 there were 7 purchase invoices from this party amounting to   all dated 18/12/15.  b) While scrutinizing the data called from M/s Mauria Udyog Limited it was noted that they have purchased these goods vide 7 purchase invoices dated 17/12/15 for  .  c) There is no other purchase/Sale by M/s Mauria Udyog Limited.  d) Similarly, in other months also 100% of the sale is made to Amrapali Group of Companies. Since M/s Mauria Udyog Limited is a group company of Jotindra Steels & Tubes Limited, there is very high possibility of accommodation bills being issued and all their purchases being Non-Genuine amounting to    for financial year 2015-16.  e) It is further observed that all the payments against these purchases' bills have been made by issuing letter of credit. It seems that the Company is getting the LC's discounted from the bank against these non-genuine bills.  When we questioned Mr. Navneet Sureka who approached Amrapali group from trust side and who was approached in Amrapali group. He answered \"he is not able to recollect\".  He didn't cooperate otherwise how it is possible that such a huge amount donated by Amrapali group companies and he is not able to remember the basic question. We recommend the amount donated 12  should be recovered from the Sureka group. We are of the opinion that the supplies and services provided by Jotindra Steel & Tubes Limited (Rs 321 crore) and Mauria Udyog Limited (Rs 128 crore) are prima facie bogus in nature.  1. The 2 directors namely Mr. Akhil Sureka and Mr. Navneet Sureka are equally responsible for companies having  shareholding/capital/profitsharing and should be held responsible for shortfall in cost of construction and land dues to Noida authorities    2. Mr. Akhil Sureka opened bank account in SBI, Patiala, Faridabad in the name of Amrapali group companies and became a signatory. Amrapali did not have any base at Faridabad but Akhil sureka operates from Faridabad.  3. Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited agreed to buy used construction equipments from Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited and paid Rs 8 crore on 13 December, 2016 and immediately transferred that funds to group companies of Sureka group namely Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited and others by routing the funds from Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited to Ultra Home Construction Private Limited.  4. The FSI's bought by Sureka group (details given in Chart D) without making any payment. The modus operandi was funds were paid from one company and on the same day were transferred to other Sureka group company by routing in 2-3 Amrapali Group companies. This would not have been possible without active involvement of Mr. Akhil Sureka, who is bank signatory. We found on sample basis that the amount of Rs. 80 crore so routed was originally started from Amrapali. The amount so claimed of Rs 80 crore has been routed through various companies. this amount has been paid out of Amrapali group against purchases and payment made to various vendors namely Bhagirathi Tubes (Prop Mr. Shiv Kumar)etc. It was confirmed by supplier that he did not have any knowledge of any of the transactions and stated that all transactions were carried out in good faith under the advice & instruction of Mr. Akhil Sureka. He further submitted that he never visited any of the Amrapali group office, he or his staff including employees has never visited any of the offices or site of Amrapali group. When questioned on supplies of scaffolding material and steel to and purchase sales reconciliation of supplies along with purchase orders and sales orders, he confirmed that it is not available. The amount so paid should be recovered from the  It was further confirmed that funds movement were also on behalf of Akhil Sureka carried out under good faith  5. An amount of Rs 55 crore was received from EXIM bank under line of credit for a project was to be done in Mozambique. The group submitted     . Out of the funds of RS 55crore, major amount was transferred to Companies of Sureka group.  On enquiry from the Amrapali Group we came to know that the bank 13  guarantee was made available by Mr. Navneet Sureka, Managing Director of Mauria Udyog Limited    . It was also informed that the project was under direct control and supervision of Mr. Navneet Sureka. It shows active involvement of Mr. Navneet Sureka in the project. Mr. Prashant Kumar and Mr. Ram Kumar are the persons who were travelling to Mozambique and know about the project but we could not get the contact details of these 2 persons  6. Quality Synthetics (Sureka Group) had given a loan to Amrapali Sapphire of RS 3 crore in March, 2009 at the rate of interest of 14% p.a. The company kept on paying to Quality Synthetics when it was having no funds for construction. The Amrapali Group was giving advances to various vendors/parties interest free and taking loan from Quality Synthetics, at the rate of 14% p.a.          It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any business and are used just for the purpose of money laundering.  7.        .  8. The directors other than the family have come and informed that they were not knowing about the operations of the company and not attended any board meeting and papers were send to their residence for signatures.  9. There are many other high value transactions which we are in process of examination.  10. Further to our supplementary report dated 30th April 2019. The directors of four companies of Sureka Group appeared before us from 9th May 2019 to 18th May 2019, the directors gave their statement On the basis of interaction in the statement given by them. We found as follows.  The four companies which bought FSI for the sham companies created for the purpose of money laundering. Neither the shareholders nor the directors of the companies were aware of any transactions carried out by these companies. It is worthwhile to note that Mr. Vishnu Sureka, Mr. Navneet Sureka and Mr. Akhil Sureka were neither the shareholders nor the directors as well didn't attend any board meeting including AGM/EGM. However, out of three who were signatory to the bank in all the companies. Directors were not aware of who have been the signatories. When questioned . Vishnu, navneet and akhil Sureka could not reply why they were the signatories when they were neither shareholders, directors, employees.  Mauria Udyog Limited  It was submitted in affidavit of Mauria Udyog Limited that Mauria Udyog Limited is a manufacturer and traders.  14                    In the 2010-11, TMT bar supplied for Rs. 52.97 crore and the payment received Rs 29 crore and that is also a major part of the payment of Rs  16.5 crore was received in March. Similarly, in the year 2012-13, supplies were made of TMT bar and the payment was received in the month of March 2012 just before closing of the year.  Suddenly in the year 2012-13, trend is changed and Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd gave an advance of Rs 33 crore on various dates which was returned subsequently in the month of February and March. The above transactions are dubious in nature because we scrutinized the supply bills of Mauria Udyog Limited and found that Mauria Udyog Limited has supplied TMT bars only to Amrapali group of companies. It is not an item in which Mauria Udyog Limited has dealt with any other party except a miniscule quantity of 2-3 customers who in turn has also supplied to Amrapali group. There was no purchase order from Amrapali group to Mauria Udyog Limited           In year 2013-14, Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd gave Rs 2.45 crore to Mauria Udyog Ltd which was returned on 29th March.        The company's bank account is used for accommodation bills and Mauria Udyog Ltd was paid an excess of Rs 1.16 crore over and above an accommodation bill. In the year 2015-16,        . In the year 2015-16, total supplies are to the extent of Rs 15.79 crore and in the year 2016-17 amounting to Rs  5.36 crore. In the year 2015-16, payments were made to Mauria Udyog Ltd on behalf of Shri Satguru Metalloys Pvt Ltd and Bhagirathi Tubes of Rs 8 crore and Rs 6.50 crore respectively. We were not explained any reasons for making such payments.  It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any business and are used just for the purpose of money laundering.    A group company of Sureka group paid Rs 1 crore to Amrapali Sapphire Developers Pvt Ltd. The entire amount along with interest payment of Rs 15  1.11 crore was paid to Shri Narayan Rajkumar Merchants Ltd, surprisingly Amrapali group didn't charge any interest on payments made to Sureka group of companies but it had paid without fail interest @ 13.45% to Shri Narayan Rajkumar Merchants Ltd.             It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any business and are used just for the purpose of money laundering.    We are of the opinion that this company floated/formed for the purpose of money laundering and FSI sold to these companies were merely accounting and adjustment entries done by them transferring funds from one account to another as reported earlier in our supplementary report. The modus operandi adopted by Sureka family was the same as adopted by Amrapali Group i.e. they formed the companies, their employees who were paid salaries in the range of Rs 20,000-Rs 60,000 the shareholders and directors in these companies. It is pertinent to note that their signatory to the bank are family members. Mr. Navneet Sureka and Mr. Akhil Sureka used these companies for the purpose of money laundering of funds of Amrapali Group. The bank guarantee was bogus and we couldn't find the bank name which issued the bank guarantee, it appears that there was a criminal conspiracy and the bank was not in existence.  Mr. Navneet Sureka was in full control of Amrapali group companies which is very clear and can be understood from the transactions of donation. On the instructions of Mr. Navneet Sureka, GM/DGM accounts Mr. Adhikari was transferring funds to the trust from various group companies of Amrapali as and when desired by him and instructed by him.  None of the directors ever attended a board meeting it was informed that the directors signed the paper under the instructions and directions of Mr. Akhil Sureka. The fact was accepted by Mr. Akhil Sureka. This proves that there was non compliances of holding board meetings and AGM as required u/s 174 of Companies Act, 2013. Further, the bank signatories to the bank are Mr. Vishnu Sureka and Mr. Navneet Sureka as an authorized signatory. In what capacity they were the signatory, they could not explain and it was told by Mr. Akhil Sureka and Mr. Vishnu Sureka that the directors were having full faith upon them therefore authorized them as bank signatory surprisingly, directors were not the signatory this is an unique case which is difficult to found in the corporate history.  When there was a transfer of shares from one shareholder to other in full or part of his/her shareholding there was no transactions for consideration through banking channels.\" 16   Mr. Navneet Surekha and Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha used the companies mentioned in the Report for the purpose of money laundering, and they were the authorised signatories also. Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha opened the bank account of Amrapali. Thus, it is apparent that the investment made by Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha cannot be treated to be an independent one. Mr. Vaibhav Jain, Architect, along with others, extended helping hand to the management and planning and execution of the scam. The following finding has been recorded in the Forensic Auditors' Report about him:-                                     17   Mr. Amit Wadhwa is the nephew of Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO of Amrapali Group of Companies. The following findings were recorded against Mr. Chander Wadhwa in the judgment:                                                   18                               With respect to Mr. Pankaj Jain and Mr. Vaibhav Jain, Directors of Vidhya Shree Buildcon Private Limited, the following findings have been  recorded in the Judgment:                       19                                                  :  \"5. It has also been pointed out by Shri Pawan K. Aggarwal in his report that so far with respect to four companies, namely, Gaurisuta Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., Vidhyashree Buildcon Pvt. Ltd., Mannat Buildcraft Pvt. Ltd. And Jhamb Finance & Leasing Pvt. Ltd., only it has been noticed that a sum of Rs.242.38 crores has been handed over to them and in most of these firms Shri Ashish Jain and Shri Vivek Mittal are the Directors. Beside, it was stated before us by Shri Anil Mittal, statutory auditor, that his nephew-Vivek Mittal joined as a Director on the request made by Shri Chander 20  Wadhwa, CFO, to create a company and he has in turn asked Shri Ashish Jain, an employee of his client, to join as another Directory of at least 10 companies, created at the request of the CFO and Amrapali Group of Companies. It is a shocking state of affairs that the statutory auditor himself was responsible for the creation of companies in an aforesaid manner. Shri Anil Mittal has also stated before us that he was aware that the money was flowing to the said companies through bank statements. However, on a specific query made by this Court to him, he has admitted that this fact of flow of money was not reflected in the audit report, which was signed by him in the audited Balance Sheet, in spite of knowing the fact that money has flown out of the accounts of the Amrapali Group of Companies to aforesaid companies.\"              XXXXXXXX                       21                    •          •                            (emphasis supplied)   With respect to Vidhya Shree Buildcon Private Limited, Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees Four Crores) is the debit balance in the books of accounts of the Amrapali Group. 22   It is apparent that a sum of Rs. 242.38 crores was handed over to Mr. Pankaj Jain (current Director of Amrapali Group & brother of Mr. Vaibhav Jain), the Director of Vidhya Shree Buildcon Pvt. Ltd.   Because of the exchange of money between Mr. Shiv Priya and Mr. Sankalp Shukla, it is apparent that a huge exchange of money was made to divert the money of home buyers of Amrapali Group and HBC 1 and HBC 2 are to be treated as Amrapali Projects.   Mr. Nishant Choubey and Mr. Santosh Choubey did not hand over the documents as they would not have supported them. It is apparent from the findings recorded by Forensic Auditors in their Report, and various circumstances pointed out that the Baseline land is to be treated as that of Amrapali Group.   The project was launched in the name of Amrapali Heartbeat City, and the agreement was entered into with the Amrapali Group by the home buyers. Cheques were issued in the name of Amrapali Heartbeat City. Letterheads of Amrapali were used for the Builder-Buyer Agreement, and the project was mentioned as Amrapali Heartbeat City. It is true canvass to suggest that the project was an independent project. We are unable to accept the aforesaid findings recorded in the Report of the Forensic Auditors. Probably, it was due to the fact that certain accounts were not made available, however, in view of the findings recorded earlier with respect to relationship and inter se transactions of the groups and parties, there is no iota of doubt that HBC 1 and HBC 2 are to be treated as the projects of Amrapali Group only and not independent projects. As per the 23  finding, the land was agreed to be sold by Baseline as per the findings recorded in the Forensic Auditors' Report itself. The same is out of the money generated by HBC 1, and HBC 2 projects and Baseline Infradevelopers Pvt. Ltd. is part and parcel of HBC 1, and HBC 2 projects and the buyers have the rights over the land and on the proceeds to be received from the sale of the land. We accept the said finding recorded in the Forensic Auditors Report.   Phase III comprises 60,000 sq.m, out of which 20,000 sq.m was already sold to some other group, and the remaining 40,000 sq.m had been agreed to be sold to M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited on 09.10.2017, with respect to which NCLT has passed an order in the Company Petition No. 141 of 2012.   The payments due to NOIDA to be paid by the purchasers are mentioned in Clause 1.2 of the MoU. The same is reproduced hereunder:-                         24  (emphasis supplied)   The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was submitted before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in the Company Petition No.141/2012. The NCLT has passed the following order on 29.11.2017:-                                     It is conceded at the Bar that the aforesaid order of NCLT has not been questioned in any of the proceedings and order based on the MoU entered into between Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited and M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited has attained finality. 25   It appears that a Writ  .) was filed concerning the Amrapali Centurian Park located at Greater Noida, in which notice was issued on 06.10.2017, which was not connected with the said plot i.e., Plot No.GH- 01/A (Alpha), Sector 107, Noida, which was the subject matter of MoU between Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited, and M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited   On 09.10.2017, the MoU was executed between Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited and M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited for the transfer of the aforesaid land. On 26.03.2018, W.P.(c) No.288/2018 was filed by Heartbeat City Homebuyers Welfare Association concerning Plot No.GH-01/C, D, and Phase 3 Plot, which is relatable to GH- 01/A/(Alpha), the plot in dispute. On 10.05.2018, this Court directed the promoters and builders not to make any transaction and alienation without permission from this Court. Thus, the agreement cannot be said to be malafide.   NOIDA canceled the lease deed on 07.09.2019; the press release/office order was issued by the NOIDA stating that on account of overdue interest and lease rent due from the Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited, the allotment of the plot in dispute had been canceled. The NOIDA issued the cancellation after becoming aware that Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited sought to transfer the plot to M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited, as per the order passed by the NCLT in November 2017. 26   M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited has filed an application No. 1023 of 2020 that plot be transferred to NOIDA as a fresh allottee. It was ready to make the payment/deposit on balance price consideration, which is Rs.191,79,79,798/-, and the dues of the NOIDA may be directed to be paid in installments. The amount payable towards completion of Heartbeat City be directed to be paid within the time stipulated by this Court. Stamp duty will be paid by M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited. Since there was no failure on the part of M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited, it should not be made liable to make the payment of overdue interest and other charges for the period. Other reliefs have also been prayed. The main relief pressed is with respect to the cancellation to be set aside due to the non-payment of the overdue interest and the lease rent and permitting the purchase of the property.   Shri Mukul Rohtagi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the NOIDA, fairly submitted that if NOIDA is paid the outstanding amount of lease rent and interest etc., it will restore the lease and has no objection to sale in favour of M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited.   The payment of dues of NOIDA Authority has to be made as per agreement by M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited to NOIDA, out of sale consideration. The rate of interest on dues to be paid, concerning the plot in question, as per order passed on 10 June 2020 as modified on 10th July 2020. On deposit of dues of NOIDA out of sale consideration, the cancellation of lease shall stand withdrawn and it shall grant time of 7 27  years to complete the project which is granted to a new lessee. We direct Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited, as per the MoU, to execute a sale deed. However, as per MoU, out of the total sale consideration, Rs.20 Crores has been paid, and the balance amount is Rs.1917979798/-. The agreement was entered into way back on 09.10.2017. The amount ought to have been paid within a reasonable time, and by now, approximately 02 years 09 months have passed. Therefore, it would be equitable to direct M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited to make payment of Rs.240 Crores in addition as outstanding amount would have earned the interest at a rate of 9% to 9.25%.   To do complete justice, it would be appropriate to quantify the outstanding amount be paid at Rs.240 Crores, in addition to the sum of Rs.20 Crores that has been paid as earnest money. The dues of the NOIDA to be paid first at first priority, and the remaining amount, which is payable to Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited shall be retained in the account of the Registry of this Court, to be used for the completion of unfinished projects of Amrapali Group. Thus, in the process at least some money would be generated for completion of projects.   It was submitted by Shri M. L. Lahoty, learned counsel and Shri Gopal Shankarnarayan, learned senior counsel, that in the brochure which was issued by Amrapali Group, the health club was shown in the project of Phase III, whereas now in the fresh plan, it has been shown in the area of HBC 1 and HBC 2 itself. The builder should be held bound by the 28  brochure, which was published. Shri M.L. Lahoty, learned counsel, has drawn our attention to Sections 12, and 14 of the RERA and Section 5(3) of The Uttar Pradesh Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership and Maintenance) Act. However, on a specific query made to Shri Lahoty, he was unable to show that application for registration was filed along with the map showing the area of the health club in Phase-III of the project. Out of Phase-III of the Project, 20000 sq.m. has already been sold to another person. Remaining 40000 sqm. was agreed to be sold to M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited and the lease of plot itself has been canceled, and it appears that an application was filed indicating the location of health club within HBC 1 and HBC 2. In the circumstances, we find that brochure cannot hold the field, particularly when the allotment of the plot itself had been canceled due to non-payment of the lease rent and interest. Considering the stand taken by the NOIDA in its reply, we find that no justification in the prayer based on the brochure, to hold that health club to be located at the place which is not available. When health club will be provided within the project of HBC 1 and HBC 2, it cannot be said that any prejudice is to be caused to the home buyers. They are going to have the same facility which was promised to be provided. Thus, we find no hesitation to reject the aforesaid prayer made on behalf of the home buyers. Let sale deed be executed on payment of Rs.240 Crores (Rupees Two Hundred and Forty Crores only) out of that firstly the dues of NOIDA are to be cleared. Let the amount of Rs.240 crores (Rupees Two Hundred and 29  Forty Crores only) be deposited by M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Ltd. in the Registry of this Court within six weeks from this date. NOIDA shall indicate its dues within 15 days. After the amount as aforesaid is deposited, the Sale Deed be executed by NOIDA and M/s. Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited in favour of M/s. Mahagun Real Estates Private Ltd. A copy of the Sale Deed be filed in the Registry of this Court, whereafter the Registry shall remit the amount representing dues of NOIDA, and the balance shall be retained and utilized for completion of projects. ………………….…..J.

The first question arises whether the Heartbeat City Projects are of Amrapali Group, and the second question is as to the agreement entered into by M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited with M/s.Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited.   It is apparent that Heartbeat City Projects were launched in the name of the 'Amrapali Heartbeat' project in 2011-2012 with Mr. M. S. Dhoni, the Brand Ambassador. The Home Buyers' agreement was entered into in the name style of Amrapali Group with the assurance that flats will be delivered within 36 months. Most of the buyers paid their dues on time, but the construction was delayed.   Heartbeat City Projects comprise Heartbeat City 1 (for short, HBC 1) and Heartbeat City 2 (for short, HBC 2) and Hanging Gardens in Noida. 2  The land for the respective projects was allotted in the name of Three Platinum Softech Private Limited, Pebbles Prolease Private Limited, and Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited. The projects were launched and advertised in the name of the Amrapali Group. Phase 3 project was started in 2011-2012 in the name of Hanging Garden; however, later on, Hanging Garden project was scrapped, and the home buyers were admittedly shifted to HBC 1 and HBC 2 or refunded the amount.   HBC 1 comprises 759 units, and HBC 2 consists of 1217 units + shops, but construction could not progress for one reason or the other.   In the Audit Report, it has been found that the land in Baseline was part and parcel of HBC 1 and HBC 2 projects and in general, under the control of the Directors of HBC 1 and HBC 2 and was purchased from the funds of the customers of HBC 1 and HBC 2 and, is an integral part of HBC 1 and HBC 2 and, therefore, customers of HBC 1 and HBC 2 have the first and the full right over the land rights and on the proceeds to be received from the sale of the land can be utilised for the construction of HBC 1 and HBC 2 projects. HBC 1 has nine towers and 785 units, of which, 675 units were sold and Rs. 147 crores recoverable from sold units. HBC 2 has 12 towers and 1282 units, out of which, 936 units were sold and Rs. 301 crores recoverable from sold units. The cost to complete HBC 1 is approximately Rs. 167.19 crores and HBC 2 is Rs. 375.64 crores, which is recoverable from unsold units.   Mr. Amit Wadhwa, Director of Amrapali Homes, has 25% shareholding. Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha, who is the Director of Bihariji 3  Ispat Udyog Ltd. and JST Engineering Services Limited, has 13% and 12% shareholding respectively, total 25%. Mr. Vaibhav Jain and Mr. Pankaj Jain, Directors, are holding 10% and 15%, total 25% of the shareholding, whereas Cozi Habitat Builders Private Limited, Maa Sharda Holding Private Limited, through its Director Mr. Sankalp Shukla is also holding 25% shares. Similarly, in HBC Phase II, the shareholding pattern is similar to 25% of the group mentioned above of Mr. Amit Wadhwa, Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha Vaibhav Jain, Mr. Pankaj Jain, and Mr. Sankalp Shukla.   In Baseline Infradevelopers Pvt. Ltd., it is stated that shareholding of Mr. Amresh Kumar is 8.25%, Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited through Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha is 8.25%, B2C Realtors Pvt. Ltd. through Mr. Vaibhav Jain and Ms. Swati Jain is 8.25%, Cozy Habitat Builders Pvt. Ltd. through Mr. Sankalp Shukla is 8.25%. Mr. Nishant Choubey and Mr. Santosh Choubey are holding 34% and 33% respectively. Mr. Nishant Choubey and Mr. Santosh Choubey did not provide documents to the Forensic Auditors; however, they possess 67% shares.   The following findings were recorded concerning Heartbeat City in our Judgment and Order dated 23.7.2019:-                       4                   Mr. Vaibhav Jain admittedly was the architect of Amrapali Group who was holding 25% shares. Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha was also holding 25% shares in each of the projects.   Concerning Surekha Group, in our Judgment and Order dated 23.7.2019, the following facts have been mentioned :-    Amrapali and Sureka's have a very long and intricate association starting officially with the partnership venture 'Amrapali Homes' in 2006 wherein Ultra Home Construction Private Limited and Mauria Udyog Limited is partner and developed project in name of Amrapali Homes in Indirapuram then Amrapali Grand wherein Ultra Home Construction Private Limited and Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited were partners, though the land was allotted to Bihariji Ispat Udyog Limited. Initially Amrapali Group ventured like these types of association as he was independently not able to meet the net worth, turnover and other eligibility criteria for land allotment by Noida authorities. They then next associated in Sapphire Project wherein Sureka's family participated as shareholders and directors in the Company. Every Joint Venture used to have an unexecuted profit sharing and investment arrangement. Since the company didn't declared dividend ever, the profits were drawn by Sureka family in the nature of advances which has majorly been squared off against billing from Mauria Udyog Limited, Jotindra Steel and their other related companies. Some of the amount is still lying as advance in the books of accounts of Amrapali Group. In 2012 Amrapali Group invested in 25% stake in Sureka family's three projects Heart Beat City, Pebbles Prolease, Three Platinum Softech. Apart from subscribing to share capital, the further investment was made directly as advance or billing from Amrapali Group to these companies and some through shell companies as well.  Further they did a project in Ultra Home Construction Private Limited with Mozambique. This project was planned, coordinated and managed by Mr Navneet Sureka in the name of Ultra Home Construction Private Limited and whatever advance was sanctioned and disbursed by the Government of Mozambique through EXIM bank to Ultra Home Construction Private Limited was eventually diverted to Sureka family through billing from Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited, Mauria Udyog 5  Limited, etc. A separate bank account of Ultra Home Construction Private Limited was opened in State Bank of Patiala, Faridabad branch where signatory was Mr Akhil Sureka who used to operate the account from there. The entire transactions of LC and EXIM bank was routed from that account. Navneet Sureka visited more in the period of contract finalization to Mozambique  Partner in the following projects:  • Amrapali Sapphire Developers Pvt. Ltd. - 10.52% of shareholding BihariJi Ispat Udyog Limited  • Amrapali Smart City Pvt Ltd - 10% shareholding held by Mauria Udyog Ltd  • Amrapali Homes - 5% - Mauria Udyog Ltd (Rs.20 crore given as an advance before 2008 and is recoverable)  • Amrapali grand - 10% BihariJi Ispat Udyog Limited -We were informed that the land was allotted in the name of Bihariji Ispat Udyog Ltd and construction and development work was done by Amrapali group.  Directors in the following companies  • Amrapali Leisure Valley Pvt Ltd - Akhil Sureka Cheque signatories in the following companies  • Amrapali Leisure Valley Pvt Ltd  • Amrapali Dream Valley Pvt Ltd  • Amrapali Leisure Valley Developers pvt Ltd  • Amrapali centurian Park Pvt Ltd From the above, it is clear that Sureka group directors namely Vishnu Sureka, Navneet Sureka and Akhil sureka were promoters in amrapali group. They were in equal control of affairs with other promoters (Anil Sharma Shiv Priya, etc.). They not only invested as a promoter heavy amount but also provided the land allotted to Bihariji Ispat a sureka group company. But the amount invested was withdrawn in a very short period by other associate companies in the form of interest, supplies, provision of services etc. it was found out that there were many other suppliers who never interacted with any of the directors/staff but supplied material to Amrapali through Akhil and Navneet Sureka. In our opinion, this was nothing but accommodation bills and a form of withdrawing funds from the group. None of the employess/ directors of the sureka companies knew that Sureka group has supplied ,material to Amrapali group. Though sureka group has a policy and procedure wthat for any item above Rs,. 5,000/- a purchase order would be issued but it was not followed in the case of supplies to Amrapali. Surprising all the transactions worth more than 500 crore has been handled single handedly by Navneet and akhil sureka without involving any of the directors and employees. All the cheques were also signed by Usreka family and not by any other directors.  It is pertinent to note that the amount paid for FSI purchased by Suraka group companies was taken back on the same day by routing through a number of companies.All such cheques for money laundering were signed by Akhil Sureka Furthermore, it is found that the amount so paid ie Rs. 80 crore was also received from suppliers of the Amrapali group. 6  Therefore in our opinion,not only FSi should be canceled but the amount os Rs. 80 crore is recovereable from them. They adopted the same methodoly. Formed various business entities, appointed small time employees the directors in these companies and routed funds of 100s of crores and it may be in the range of 1000s crores.. None of the directors were knowing about any of the business transactions. Further more most of the directors never attended any board meetings,knew about nature of business the company does, name of other directors in the company and so on. We are not sure who was teacing the fraudlent practices to whom, whether Sureka to Amrapali or vice versa.  It was observed Rs.13.44 crore paid to Sureka Public Charitable Trust were transferred to donation account subsequently. It is submitted that Sureka Public Charitable Trust is a group institution of Jotindra Steels & Tubes Limited, which is also under the forensic audit. This should be recovered from the Jotindra Steels & Tubes Limited. Sureka group used several companies to route funds from Amrapali group to Sureka group, an example being in the case of Amrapali Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, where the company received Rs.3.23 crore from \"Synergy Freightways Private Limited\" from 26th March 2015 to 30th March 2015. On 31st March 2015 an amount to Rs.4.18 crore was paid to the said party through 16 separate transactions and thereby leading to a debit balance recoverable from the party amounting to Rs.0.9,5 crore as on 31st March 2015. This amount should be recovered from the Sureka Group.  It is worthwhile to mention here that M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited is an associate Company of M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited. Further, there are no business transactions with the said party except routing of funds.  Another example being in the case of Shriv Buildmat Private Limited where one of the directors is common with MauriaUdyog Limited. On scrutiny of ledger accounts of Shriv Buildmat, it was observed that during FY  -15 and 2015-16, the said company had almost 100% sales to Amrapali group of companies. It was also observed that one flat was allotted to Mr. Atul Kumar, Director of ShrivBuildmat Private Limited in Verona Heights, against the amount due to the said company. This adjustment is not genuine and the relevant amount should be recovered from Mr. Atul Kumar or his flat may be attached. As per ledger account advance to Amrapali for flat, a sum of INR 34.05 lakhs has been shown as recoverable as on 31st March, 2015. There is no name of the Company to which such advance has been given in the books of the Amrapali Group of Companies. Thus, this amount of INR 34.05 Lakhs is shown as recoverable is not genuine.  A sum of INR 53.21 Lakhs has been debited to Labour Charges Contractors on account of bill no. SBPL/Noida/010 dated 13/3/2013 has been recorded in the books of Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited on 16/03/2015.   7  During the financial year 2016-17 and 2017-18, a sum of     has been debited to this party and standing recoverable as per Raw Tally Data, till date as per details given below:    Further, there is no Name, Pan or Address available in the records of  M/s RN Traders. It was further observed that there are no business  transactions with M/s RN Traders. It is possible that this amount of     has been withdrawn by the management for their own  personal use and should be recovered from the management.  BiharijiIspat Udyog Limited being one of the partners of Amrapali Grand  always had negative capital. They withdrew much more than what they  brought into the business. There is no substance in them being called as  capital contributors to the business of Amrapali Grand. As on 1st April  2008 they had withdrawn INR 12 crore and invested a capital  contribution of INR 1.5 crore. As on 31st July 2018, they have debit  balance of INR 1.67 crore and negative capital of INR 30,380. They  always withdrew homebuyers funds for misusing for their own agendas  apart from the business.  Out of INR 12 crore given to BihariJiIspat Udyog Limited, they returned  INR 6.45 crore through bank and the balance amount was adjusted  against receivables from Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd and against  capital contribution by BiharijiIspat Udyog Ltd.  Amrapali Grand gave loans and advances to below parties, which are  recoverable as on 31 July 2018 amounting to INR 25.73 crore as per  Tally data. 8        It has been observed that amounts paid to parties above were mostly routed to Quality Synthetics Pvt Ltd which primarily belongs Sureka family. For example:  a) Payment of Rs 2,74,68,000/- has been made to Mr Ajay Kumar from 2007-08 to 2010-11 as advance recoverable. Out of this, Rs 77,00,000 was paid by him for purchase of property located at Jaypee Greens, Noida & Rs 50,00,000 was paid by him to Quality Synthetics Industries Limited.  b) Payment of Rs 10,03,55,900 has been made to Mr Anil Kumar Sharma from 2007-08 to July, 2018. Out of this, Rs 3,00,00,000 was paid to Quality Synthetics Industries Limited.  c) Payment of Rs 7,10,50,000 has been made to Mr Shiv Priya from 2007-08 to September 2010. Out of this, Rs 1,00,00,000 was paid to Quality Synthetics Industries Limited. 9  While reviewing the books of accounts of Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited and M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited, it has been observed that Amrapali Infrastructure has made purchases from M/s Jotindra Steel against Letter of Credit. The letter of credit has been discounted by M/s Jotindra Steel with the banks. The discounting charges of INR 1.30 Crores have been debited by M/s Jotindra Steel to M/s Amrapali Infrastructure. We fail to understand the reason for this treatment. In normal course of business, the supplier is the person who bears the discounting charges in respect of the transactions as the margin when sold on Letter of Credit are generally higher. This amount of     on account of discounting charges of Letter of Credit Should be recovered from M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited.  i. It has also been observed that M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited has issued service invoices for erection, shifting and transportation charges amounting to   approximately during the financial year  -15 as per details given below:        Jotindra Steels & E r ection   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r ansportation    Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  12/1/  Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  12/1/  Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  2/1/2015 Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  2/1/2015 Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  3/31/2015 Bill not available Tubes   Charges Jotindra  Steels & T r a n sportation  3/31/2015 Bill not available Tubes     Further, on scrutiny of the invoices issued by the JSTB it appears that the invoices raised for the above services are completely different from the invoices issued regularly and are prima facie non-genuine. Hence, the same should be recovered from JSTB or the Company Management as both the parties have been partnering in various projects. 10  ii. It is further observed that purchases amounting to INR 7.09 Crores, INR 59.53 Crores and INR 47.04 Crores has been made from this party in M/s Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited during the financial year 2013-14,  -15 and 2015-16 respectively. While sample checking of the purchase bills, it was noted that the goods consignment notes enclosed with the purchase bill are issued by M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited which is also a group Company of Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited. Goods consignment note enclosed with the purchase bills don't seem to be genuine in view of the undermentioned observations:  1. We sent a letter to M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited as per address on record which has been received back as undelivered.  2. Statement of Mr. Akhil Sureka, Managing Director of M/s Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited was recorded and it was confirmed by him that most of the purchase/ sales transactions are back to back i.e. all such consignments are sent directly from their supplier to Amrapali Group of Companies. In these circumstances it is not understood by us that how the consignment notes of M/s Synergy Freightways Private Limited have been enclosed with most of the purchase bills, if the transactions were back to back for their supplies.                Further, most of the purchase invoices of JST have been shown as sale on the same date with similar particulars/ quantity by raising the invoice on Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited.  We are of the view that these sales invoices raised by JST are also not genuine and are mere accommodation entries only.  Sample details of such transactions for 2 days are enclosed below:   11     It has been further observed that there have been unaccounted cash transactions between the Amrapali Group of Companies and JSTB group of Companies as per documents seized during Income Tax Search in the premises of JSTB Group of Companies which are not accounted for in the Amrapali Group of Companies. Complete Copy of the Order of CIT (Appeals) where the observations regarding unaccounted cash were discussed is enclosed herewith as     While scrutinizing the ledger of this party it was observed as follows:  a) During the month of December 2015 there were 7 purchase invoices from this party amounting to   all dated 18/12/15.  b) While scrutinizing the data called from M/s Mauria Udyog Limited it was noted that they have purchased these goods vide 7 purchase invoices dated 17/12/15 for  .  c) There is no other purchase/Sale by M/s Mauria Udyog Limited.  d) Similarly, in other months also 100% of the sale is made to Amrapali Group of Companies. Since M/s Mauria Udyog Limited is a group company of Jotindra Steels & Tubes Limited, there is very high possibility of accommodation bills being issued and all their purchases being Non-Genuine amounting to    for financial year 2015-16.  e) It is further observed that all the payments against these purchases' bills have been made by issuing letter of credit. It seems that the Company is getting the LC's discounted from the bank against these non-genuine bills.  When we questioned Mr. Navneet Sureka who approached Amrapali group from trust side and who was approached in Amrapali group. He answered \"he is not able to recollect\".  He didn't cooperate otherwise how it is possible that such a huge amount donated by Amrapali group companies and he is not able to remember the basic question. We recommend the amount donated 12  should be recovered from the Sureka group. We are of the opinion that the supplies and services provided by Jotindra Steel & Tubes Limited (Rs 321 crore) and Mauria Udyog Limited (Rs 128 crore) are prima facie bogus in nature.  1. The 2 directors namely Mr. Akhil Sureka and Mr. Navneet Sureka are equally responsible for companies having  shareholding/capital/profitsharing and should be held responsible for shortfall in cost of construction and land dues to Noida authorities    2. Mr. Akhil Sureka opened bank account in SBI, Patiala, Faridabad in the name of Amrapali group companies and became a signatory. Amrapali did not have any base at Faridabad but Akhil sureka operates from Faridabad.  3. Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited agreed to buy used construction equipments from Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited and paid Rs 8 crore on 13 December, 2016 and immediately transferred that funds to group companies of Sureka group namely Jotindra Steel and Tubes Limited and others by routing the funds from Amrapali Infrastructure Private Limited to Ultra Home Construction Private Limited.  4. The FSI's bought by Sureka group (details given in Chart D) without making any payment. The modus operandi was funds were paid from one company and on the same day were transferred to other Sureka group company by routing in 2-3 Amrapali Group companies. This would not have been possible without active involvement of Mr. Akhil Sureka, who is bank signatory. We found on sample basis that the amount of Rs. 80 crore so routed was originally started from Amrapali. The amount so claimed of Rs 80 crore has been routed through various companies. this amount has been paid out of Amrapali group against purchases and payment made to various vendors namely Bhagirathi Tubes (Prop Mr. Shiv Kumar)etc. It was confirmed by supplier that he did not have any knowledge of any of the transactions and stated that all transactions were carried out in good faith under the advice & instruction of Mr. Akhil Sureka. He further submitted that he never visited any of the Amrapali group office, he or his staff including employees has never visited any of the offices or site of Amrapali group. When questioned on supplies of scaffolding material and steel to and purchase sales reconciliation of supplies along with purchase orders and sales orders, he confirmed that it is not available. The amount so paid should be recovered from the  It was further confirmed that funds movement were also on behalf of Akhil Sureka carried out under good faith  5. An amount of Rs 55 crore was received from EXIM bank under line of credit for a project was to be done in Mozambique. The group submitted     . Out of the funds of RS 55crore, major amount was transferred to Companies of Sureka group.  On enquiry from the Amrapali Group we came to know that the bank 13  guarantee was made available by Mr. Navneet Sureka, Managing Director of Mauria Udyog Limited    . It was also informed that the project was under direct control and supervision of Mr. Navneet Sureka. It shows active involvement of Mr. Navneet Sureka in the project. Mr. Prashant Kumar and Mr. Ram Kumar are the persons who were travelling to Mozambique and know about the project but we could not get the contact details of these 2 persons  6. Quality Synthetics (Sureka Group) had given a loan to Amrapali Sapphire of RS 3 crore in March, 2009 at the rate of interest of 14% p.a. The company kept on paying to Quality Synthetics when it was having no funds for construction. The Amrapali Group was giving advances to various vendors/parties interest free and taking loan from Quality Synthetics, at the rate of 14% p.a.          It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any business and are used just for the purpose of money laundering.  7.        .  8. The directors other than the family have come and informed that they were not knowing about the operations of the company and not attended any board meeting and papers were send to their residence for signatures.  9. There are many other high value transactions which we are in process of examination.  10. Further to our supplementary report dated 30th April 2019. The directors of four companies of Sureka Group appeared before us from 9th May 2019 to 18th May 2019, the directors gave their statement On the basis of interaction in the statement given by them. We found as follows.  The four companies which bought FSI for the sham companies created for the purpose of money laundering. Neither the shareholders nor the directors of the companies were aware of any transactions carried out by these companies. It is worthwhile to note that Mr. Vishnu Sureka, Mr. Navneet Sureka and Mr. Akhil Sureka were neither the shareholders nor the directors as well didn't attend any board meeting including AGM/EGM. However, out of three who were signatory to the bank in all the companies. Directors were not aware of who have been the signatories. When questioned . Vishnu, navneet and akhil Sureka could not reply why they were the signatories when they were neither shareholders, directors, employees.  Mauria Udyog Limited  It was submitted in affidavit of Mauria Udyog Limited that Mauria Udyog Limited is a manufacturer and traders.  14                    In the 2010-11, TMT bar supplied for Rs. 52.97 crore and the payment received Rs 29 crore and that is also a major part of the payment of Rs  16.5 crore was received in March. Similarly, in the year 2012-13, supplies were made of TMT bar and the payment was received in the month of March 2012 just before closing of the year.  Suddenly in the year 2012-13, trend is changed and Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd gave an advance of Rs 33 crore on various dates which was returned subsequently in the month of February and March. The above transactions are dubious in nature because we scrutinized the supply bills of Mauria Udyog Limited and found that Mauria Udyog Limited has supplied TMT bars only to Amrapali group of companies. It is not an item in which Mauria Udyog Limited has dealt with any other party except a miniscule quantity of 2-3 customers who in turn has also supplied to Amrapali group. There was no purchase order from Amrapali group to Mauria Udyog Limited           In year 2013-14, Ultra Home Construction Pvt Ltd gave Rs 2.45 crore to Mauria Udyog Ltd which was returned on 29th March.        The company's bank account is used for accommodation bills and Mauria Udyog Ltd was paid an excess of Rs 1.16 crore over and above an accommodation bill. In the year 2015-16,        . In the year 2015-16, total supplies are to the extent of Rs 15.79 crore and in the year 2016-17 amounting to Rs  5.36 crore. In the year 2015-16, payments were made to Mauria Udyog Ltd on behalf of Shri Satguru Metalloys Pvt Ltd and Bhagirathi Tubes of Rs 8 crore and Rs 6.50 crore respectively. We were not explained any reasons for making such payments.  It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any business and are used just for the purpose of money laundering.    A group company of Sureka group paid Rs 1 crore to Amrapali Sapphire Developers Pvt Ltd. The entire amount along with interest payment of Rs 15  1.11 crore was paid to Shri Narayan Rajkumar Merchants Ltd, surprisingly Amrapali group didn't charge any interest on payments made to Sureka group of companies but it had paid without fail interest @ 13.45% to Shri Narayan Rajkumar Merchants Ltd.             It is pertinent to note that the company is not doing any business and are used just for the purpose of money laundering.    We are of the opinion that this company floated/formed for the purpose of money laundering and FSI sold to these companies were merely accounting and adjustment entries done by them transferring funds from one account to another as reported earlier in our supplementary report. The modus operandi adopted by Sureka family was the same as adopted by Amrapali Group i.e. they formed the companies, their employees who were paid salaries in the range of Rs 20,000-Rs 60,000 the shareholders and directors in these companies. It is pertinent to note that their signatory to the bank are family members. Mr. Navneet Sureka and Mr. Akhil Sureka used these companies for the purpose of money laundering of funds of Amrapali Group. The bank guarantee was bogus and we couldn't find the bank name which issued the bank guarantee, it appears that there was a criminal conspiracy and the bank was not in existence.  Mr. Navneet Sureka was in full control of Amrapali group companies which is very clear and can be understood from the transactions of donation. On the instructions of Mr. Navneet Sureka, GM/DGM accounts Mr. Adhikari was transferring funds to the trust from various group companies of Amrapali as and when desired by him and instructed by him.  None of the directors ever attended a board meeting it was informed that the directors signed the paper under the instructions and directions of Mr. Akhil Sureka. The fact was accepted by Mr. Akhil Sureka. This proves that there was non compliances of holding board meetings and AGM as required u/s 174 of Companies Act, 2013. Further, the bank signatories to the bank are Mr. Vishnu Sureka and Mr. Navneet Sureka as an authorized signatory. In what capacity they were the signatory, they could not explain and it was told by Mr. Akhil Sureka and Mr. Vishnu Sureka that the directors were having full faith upon them therefore authorized them as bank signatory surprisingly, directors were not the signatory this is an unique case which is difficult to found in the corporate history.  When there was a transfer of shares from one shareholder to other in full or part of his/her shareholding there was no transactions for consideration through banking channels.\" 16   Mr. Navneet Surekha and Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha used the companies mentioned in the Report for the purpose of money laundering, and they were the authorised signatories also. Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha opened the bank account of Amrapali. Thus, it is apparent that the investment made by Mr. Akhil Kumar Surekha cannot be treated to be an independent one. Mr. Vaibhav Jain, Architect, along with others, extended helping hand to the management and planning and execution of the scam. The following finding has been recorded in the Forensic Auditors' Report about him:-                                     17   Mr. Amit Wadhwa is the nephew of Mr. Chander Wadhwa, CFO of Amrapali Group of Companies. The following findings were recorded against Mr. Chander Wadhwa in the judgment:                                                   18                               With respect to Mr. Pankaj Jain and Mr. Vaibhav Jain, Directors of Vidhya Shree Buildcon Private Limited, the following findings have been  recorded in the Judgment:                       19                                                  :  \"5. It has also been pointed out by Shri Pawan K. Aggarwal in his report that so far with respect to four companies, namely, Gaurisuta Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd., Vidhyashree Buildcon Pvt. Ltd., Mannat Buildcraft Pvt. Ltd. And Jhamb Finance & Leasing Pvt. Ltd., only it has been noticed that a sum of Rs.242.38 crores has been handed over to them and in most of these firms Shri Ashish Jain and Shri Vivek Mittal are the Directors. Beside, it was stated before us by Shri Anil Mittal, statutory auditor, that his nephew-Vivek Mittal joined as a Director on the request made by Shri Chander 20  Wadhwa, CFO, to create a company and he has in turn asked Shri Ashish Jain, an employee of his client, to join as another Directory of at least 10 companies, created at the request of the CFO and Amrapali Group of Companies. It is a shocking state of affairs that the statutory auditor himself was responsible for the creation of companies in an aforesaid manner. Shri Anil Mittal has also stated before us that he was aware that the money was flowing to the said companies through bank statements. However, on a specific query made by this Court to him, he has admitted that this fact of flow of money was not reflected in the audit report, which was signed by him in the audited Balance Sheet, in spite of knowing the fact that money has flown out of the accounts of the Amrapali Group of Companies to aforesaid companies.\"              XXXXXXXX                       21                    •          •                            (emphasis supplied)   With respect to Vidhya Shree Buildcon Private Limited, Rs. 4,00,00,000/- (Rupees Four Crores) is the debit balance in the books of accounts of the Amrapali Group. 22   It is apparent that a sum of Rs. 242.38 crores was handed over to Mr. Pankaj Jain (current Director of Amrapali Group & brother of Mr. Vaibhav Jain), the Director of Vidhya Shree Buildcon Pvt. Ltd.   Because of the exchange of money between Mr. Shiv Priya and Mr. Sankalp Shukla, it is apparent that a huge exchange of money was made to divert the money of home buyers of Amrapali Group and HBC 1 and HBC 2 are to be treated as Amrapali Projects.   Mr. Nishant Choubey and Mr. Santosh Choubey did not hand over the documents as they would not have supported them. It is apparent from the findings recorded by Forensic Auditors in their Report, and various circumstances pointed out that the Baseline land is to be treated as that of Amrapali Group.   The project was launched in the name of Amrapali Heartbeat City, and the agreement was entered into with the Amrapali Group by the home buyers. Cheques were issued in the name of Amrapali Heartbeat City. Letterheads of Amrapali were used for the Builder-Buyer Agreement, and the project was mentioned as Amrapali Heartbeat City. It is true canvass to suggest that the project was an independent project. We are unable to accept the aforesaid findings recorded in the Report of the Forensic Auditors. Probably, it was due to the fact that certain accounts were not made available, however, in view of the findings recorded earlier with respect to relationship and inter se transactions of the groups and parties, there is no iota of doubt that HBC 1 and HBC 2 are to be treated as the projects of Amrapali Group only and not independent projects. As per the 23  finding, the land was agreed to be sold by Baseline as per the findings recorded in the Forensic Auditors' Report itself. The same is out of the money generated by HBC 1, and HBC 2 projects and Baseline Infradevelopers Pvt. Ltd. is part and parcel of HBC 1, and HBC 2 projects and the buyers have the rights over the land and on the proceeds to be received from the sale of the land. We accept the said finding recorded in the Forensic Auditors Report.   Phase III comprises 60,000 sq.m, out of which 20,000 sq.m was already sold to some other group, and the remaining 40,000 sq.m had been agreed to be sold to M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited on 09.10.2017, with respect to which NCLT has passed an order in the Company Petition No. 141 of 2012.   The payments due to NOIDA to be paid by the purchasers are mentioned in Clause 1.2 of the MoU. The same is reproduced hereunder:-                         24  (emphasis supplied)   The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was submitted before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in the Company Petition No.141/2012. The NCLT has passed the following order on 29.11.2017:-                                     It is conceded at the Bar that the aforesaid order of NCLT has not been questioned in any of the proceedings and order based on the MoU entered into between Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited and M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited has attained finality. 25   It appears that a Writ  .) was filed concerning the Amrapali Centurian Park located at Greater Noida, in which notice was issued on 06.10.2017, which was not connected with the said plot i.e., Plot No.GH- 01/A (Alpha), Sector 107, Noida, which was the subject matter of MoU between Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited, and M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited   On 09.10.2017, the MoU was executed between Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited and M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited for the transfer of the aforesaid land. On 26.03.2018, W.P.(c) No.288/2018 was filed by Heartbeat City Homebuyers Welfare Association concerning Plot No.GH-01/C, D, and Phase 3 Plot, which is relatable to GH- 01/A/(Alpha), the plot in dispute. On 10.05.2018, this Court directed the promoters and builders not to make any transaction and alienation without permission from this Court. Thus, the agreement cannot be said to be malafide.   NOIDA canceled the lease deed on 07.09.2019; the press release/office order was issued by the NOIDA stating that on account of overdue interest and lease rent due from the Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited, the allotment of the plot in dispute had been canceled. The NOIDA issued the cancellation after becoming aware that Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited sought to transfer the plot to M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited, as per the order passed by the NCLT in November 2017. 26   M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited has filed an application No. 1023 of 2020 that plot be transferred to NOIDA as a fresh allottee. It was ready to make the payment/deposit on balance price consideration, which is Rs.191,79,79,798/-, and the dues of the NOIDA may be directed to be paid in installments. The amount payable towards completion of Heartbeat City be directed to be paid within the time stipulated by this Court. Stamp duty will be paid by M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited. Since there was no failure on the part of M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited, it should not be made liable to make the payment of overdue interest and other charges for the period. Other reliefs have also been prayed. The main relief pressed is with respect to the cancellation to be set aside due to the non-payment of the overdue interest and the lease rent and permitting the purchase of the property.   Shri Mukul Rohtagi, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the NOIDA, fairly submitted that if NOIDA is paid the outstanding amount of lease rent and interest etc., it will restore the lease and has no objection to sale in favour of M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited.   The payment of dues of NOIDA Authority has to be made as per agreement by M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited to NOIDA, out of sale consideration. The rate of interest on dues to be paid, concerning the plot in question, as per order passed on 10 June 2020 as modified on 10th July 2020. On deposit of dues of NOIDA out of sale consideration, the cancellation of lease shall stand withdrawn and it shall grant time of 7 27  years to complete the project which is granted to a new lessee. We direct Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited, as per the MoU, to execute a sale deed. However, as per MoU, out of the total sale consideration, Rs.20 Crores has been paid, and the balance amount is Rs.1917979798/-. The agreement was entered into way back on 09.10.2017. The amount ought to have been paid within a reasonable time, and by now, approximately 02 years 09 months have passed. Therefore, it would be equitable to direct M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited to make payment of Rs.240 Crores in addition as outstanding amount would have earned the interest at a rate of 9% to 9.25%.   To do complete justice, it would be appropriate to quantify the outstanding amount be paid at Rs.240 Crores, in addition to the sum of Rs.20 Crores that has been paid as earnest money. The dues of the NOIDA to be paid first at first priority, and the remaining amount, which is payable to Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited shall be retained in the account of the Registry of this Court, to be used for the completion of unfinished projects of Amrapali Group. Thus, in the process at least some money would be generated for completion of projects.   It was submitted by Shri M. L. Lahoty, learned counsel and Shri Gopal Shankarnarayan, learned senior counsel, that in the brochure which was issued by Amrapali Group, the health club was shown in the project of Phase III, whereas now in the fresh plan, it has been shown in the area of HBC 1 and HBC 2 itself. The builder should be held bound by the 28  brochure, which was published. Shri M.L. Lahoty, learned counsel, has drawn our attention to Sections 12, and 14 of the RERA and Section 5(3) of The Uttar Pradesh Apartment (Promotion of Construction, Ownership and Maintenance) Act. However, on a specific query made to Shri Lahoty, he was unable to show that application for registration was filed along with the map showing the area of the health club in Phase-III of the project. Out of Phase-III of the Project, 20000 sq.m. has already been sold to another person. Remaining 40000 sqm. was agreed to be sold to M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Limited and the lease of plot itself has been canceled, and it appears that an application was filed indicating the location of health club within HBC 1 and HBC 2. In the circumstances, we find that brochure cannot hold the field, particularly when the allotment of the plot itself had been canceled due to non-payment of the lease rent and interest. Considering the stand taken by the NOIDA in its reply, we find that no justification in the prayer based on the brochure, to hold that health club to be located at the place which is not available. When health club will be provided within the project of HBC 1 and HBC 2, it cannot be said that any prejudice is to be caused to the home buyers. They are going to have the same facility which was promised to be provided. Thus, we find no hesitation to reject the aforesaid prayer made on behalf of the home buyers. Let sale deed be executed on payment of Rs.240 Crores (Rupees Two Hundred and Forty Crores only) out of that firstly the dues of NOIDA are to be cleared. Let the amount of Rs.240 crores (Rupees Two Hundred and 29  Forty Crores only) be deposited by M/s. Mahagun Real Estate Private Ltd. in the Registry of this Court within six weeks from this date. NOIDA shall indicate its dues within 15 days. After the amount as aforesaid is deposited, the Sale Deed be executed by NOIDA and M/s. Baseline Infradevelopers Private Limited in favour of M/s. Mahagun Real Estates Private Ltd. A copy of the Sale Deed be filed in the Registry of this Court, whereafter the Registry shall remit the amount representing dues of NOIDA, and the balance shall be retained and utilized for completion of projects. ………………….…..J.
